            <br><br>
            The 124 comments revealed deeply divided perspectives on marriage, commitment, and personal fulfillment.

        <h2>The Lasting Love Perspective</h2>
        <div class="perspective-group">
            <p>Many commenters shared stories of enduring marriages marked by deep companionship and unwavering commitment. These responses often came from widows and widowers who emphasized what they lost.</p>
            
            <div class="theme">
                <div class="theme-title">Key Themes:</div>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Daily devotion:</strong> Couples who ate dinner together nightly, never went to bed angry, and maintained conversation throughout decades</li>
                    <li><strong>Love at first sight:</strong> Multiple commenters described instant connection that lasted 40-50+ years</li>
                    <li><strong>Loss and longing:</strong> Widows/widowers expressing ongoing grief and the irreplaceable nature of their partnerships</li>

                "My husband died after 52 years of our life together... We always had stuff to talk about at dinner, which we ate together every night for 95% of our lives together... I can't imagine having done the same, and every day my husband is gone I miss him."
            </div>

            <div class="comment-example">
                <span class="commenter">Jack, New England</span> <span class="location">(567 recommendations)</span><br>
                "Death would break up my 58 year marriage and nothing else. My wife and I still have companionship, love, and yes, passion."
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>The "Commitment Above All" Critics</h2>
        <div class="perspective-group">
            <p>A significant group viewed the author's decision as representing broader societal decay, particularly around the meaning of promises and commitment.</p>
            
            <div class="theme">
                <div class="theme-title">Arguments Presented:</div>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Vows are binding:</strong> "When you promise, it sticks" regardless of changing feelings</li>
                    <li><strong>Selfishness concerns:</strong> Leaving described as "selfishness masquerading as inspiration"</li>
                    <li><strong>Cultural decline:</strong> "Everything in this country is disposable"</li>
                    <li><strong>Shallow reasoning:</strong> Criticism that differences in interests aren't sufficient grounds for separation</li>
                    <li><strong>Working through difficulties:</strong> Marriage requires effort when it's no longer "glossy"</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="comment-example">
                <span class="commenter">John Brown, Washington D.C.</span> <span class="location">(2,338 recommendations)</span><br>
                "This is selfishness masquerading as inspiration. Why is anyone surprised that maintaining a lifelong relationship is hard?"
            </div>

            <div class="comment-example">
                <span class="commenter">GrimW, CA</span> <span class="location">(1,357 recommendations)</span><br>
                "I find myself asking how you so easily let go of a relationship you imply was once deep. I would never give up my marriage for the transient and superficial reasons you've provided."
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>The Supportive Liberation Voices</h2>
        <div class="perspective-group">
            <p>Many readers, particularly women, celebrated the author's choice and shared their own experiences of leaving marriages that were "not bad" but unfulfilling.</p>
            
            <div class="theme">
                <div class="theme-title">Common Experiences:</div>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Living with less:</strong> Recognizing they had settled for far below their needs</li>
                    <li><strong>One-sided labor:</strong> Emotional and domestic work disproportionately carried by women</li>
                    <li><strong>Relief after leaving:</strong> Physical manifestations of stress relief (weight loss, health improvements)</li>
                    <li><strong>No regrets:</strong> Choosing themselves over obligation</li>
                    <li><strong>Loneliness within marriage:</strong> "The worst kind of loneliness, that which you feel with a partner sleeping next to you"</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="comment-example">
                <span class="commenter">Emily, The South</span> <span class="location">(522 recommendations)</span><br>
                "Society is terrified of women who choose freedom and independence... women are supposed to stay in marriages where they are unhappy until the end of time because, generally, it's men who benefit from these unhappy marriages."
            </div>

            <div class="comment-example">
                <span class="commenter">stacey, pnw</span> <span class="location">(400 recommendations)</span><br>
                "After 20 years with most sacrifices being one-sided, I realized my 'partner' was not willing to do so much as make dinner for me while I took care of my dying mother... Though I'm occasionally lonely, I would rather that than living with someone who contributed nothing."
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>The Nuanced Middle Ground</h2>
        <div class="perspective-group">
            <p>Some commenters acknowledged complexity, recognizing that both staying and leaving can be valid choices depending on circumstances.</p>
            
            <div class="theme">
                <div class="theme-title">Key Points:</div>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>People change:</strong> Sometimes growth takes partners in different directions</li>
                    <li><strong>Context matters:</strong> What works for one couple may not work for another</li>
                    <li><strong>Multiple marriages to one person:</strong> References to Esther Perel's concept of having several marriages to the same spouse</li>
                    <li><strong>Success isn't only longevity:</strong> A marriage that ends doesn't negate the good years</li>
                    <li><strong>Children's perspectives vary:</strong> Some adult children wished parents had divorced sooner; others were hurt by divorce</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                "Marriage is always, ever, about change... Why do I stay—because I want to know what is on that next page in a book we are mutually writing. More than I want to write it without that person."

        </div>

        <h2>Specific Deal-Breakers Mentioned</h2>
        <div class="theme">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Abuse:</strong> Physical violence, screaming, threats</li>
                <li><strong>Lack of partnership:</strong> One partner unwilling to communicate or contribute</li>
                <li><strong>Infidelity:</strong> Though some tried to work through it</li>
                <li><strong>Living as if single:</strong> Partners who acted unilaterally</li>
                <li><strong>Refusal to address issues:</strong> Partners unwilling to attend therapy or acknowledge problems</li>
                <li><strong>Emotional shutdown:</strong> Complete withdrawal from connection</li>
                <li><strong>Sexless marriage:</strong> When one partner expects the other to accept no intimacy</li>
                <li><strong>Privacy violations:</strong> Reading journals or other breaches of trust</li>
                <li><strong>Mental health issues:</strong> Especially when untreated or unacknowledged</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>The Financial Arrangement Controversy</h2>
        <div class="perspective-group">
            <p>The author's statement that they remain legally married for "health insurance and tax reasons" generated significant debate.</p>
            
            <div class="theme">
                <div class="theme-title">Reactions:</div>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Fraud concerns:</strong> Questions about whether this arrangement constitutes insurance fraud</li>
                    <li><strong>Contradiction critique:</strong> Claims of independence while relying on ex-spouse's benefits</li>
                    <li><strong>Legal complications:</strong> Warnings about Medicaid clawbacks and other legal risks</li>
                    <li><strong>Defense:</strong> Others noted this is common and practical, especially for couples who earned together</li>
                    <li><strong>Comparison to open marriage:</strong> Several suggested this arrangement essentially describes an open marriage rather than a divorce</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>Notable Counternarratives</h2>

                "I wed at 19 and was happily married for over 32 years... But then I had an affair... which showed me what life beyond could be... We are still legally married after 6 years because he is a good man and provides me with health insurance... I never again want to live with a man or remarry. I have plenty of lovers and boyfriends and so many great friends."

                "When I thought about going through chemo and end of life/hospice plans, I realized I wanted my daughter with me but my husband nowhere near. In the two years after separation, I lost 100 pounds I'd put on through constant stress eating. I didn't even try. The release from stress was so enormous."
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>The Author's Responses</h2>
        <div class="perspective-group">
            <p>Cathi Hanauer (CH) responded to several critics directly, revealing additional context:</p>
            
            <div class="comment-example">
                <span class="commenter">CH to Jeff M:</span><br>
                "I loved my husband almost from the moment we met. (I still do, in some ways!)... But—things change. People change, and grow, and evolve... lots of men are stunned when their wives walk out—they never saw it coming. Remember, 70-plus percent of all divorce is initiated by women."

            <div class="comment-example">
                <span class="commenter">CH to Emily:</span><br>
                "Thanks, and well-put. Society hates nothing more than a happy single woman."
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>Emerging Patterns</h2>
        <div class="theme">
            <div class="theme-title">Gender Dynamics:</div>
            <ul>
                <li>Women more likely to report unequal emotional/domestic labor as deal-breakers</li>
                <li>Women initiate 70%+ of divorces (80-90% among college-educated)</li>
                <li>Men more likely to express bewilderment when marriages end</li>
                <li>Discussion of how marriage benefits men and women differently</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="theme-title">Generational Perspectives:</div>
            <ul>
                <li>Longer lifespans make "til death" more daunting (30+ additional years)</li>
                <li>Empty nest as natural transition point</li>
                <li>"Gray divorce" increasingly common</li>
                <li>Shift from obligation-based to fulfillment-based marriage expectations</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="theme-title">The Judgment Factor:</div>
            <ul>
                <li>Many expressed surprise at harsh, judgmental comments</li>
                <li>Others defended right to comment on public sharing of controversial choices</li>
                <li>Tension between "live and let live" and defending traditional values</li>
                <li>Personal stakes high for those in long marriages who've "done the work"</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Concluding Observations</h2>
        <div class="perspective-group">
            <p>The comments revealed that discussions of marriage and divorce touch fundamental questions about:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The nature of commitment:</strong> Is it absolute or conditional?</li>
                <li><strong>The purpose of marriage:</strong> Companionship, love, stability, or personal growth?</li>
                <li><strong>Individual vs. collective good:</strong> When do personal needs outweigh vows?</li>
                <li><strong>Success metrics:</strong> Is a 30-year marriage that ends a failure or a success?</li>
                <li><strong>Gender and power:</strong> How do traditional marriage structures serve different parties?</li>
                <li><strong>Societal change:</strong> Are we evolving or degrading as relationships become more flexible?</li>
            </ul>

            <p style="margin-top: 20px; padding: 15px; background-color: #f0f0f0; border-left: 4px solid #326891;">
                <strong>The through-line:</strong> Nearly every commenter believed deeply in their own position, suggesting that marriage remains one of society's most emotionally charged institutions. The diversity of responses illustrated that there may be no single "right" answer—only what's right for specific individuals in specific circumstances at specific times in their lives.
