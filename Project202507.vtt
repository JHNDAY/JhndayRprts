1
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.960
hal shear: Wow, yeah, thank you.

2
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.389
hal shear: Yeah, they are one.

3
00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:46.730
hal shear: Yeah.

4
00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:52.319
hal shear: there you go.

5
00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.883
hal shear: Oh, great.

6
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.229
John Day: Oh, hello! Hal!

7
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:43.850
hal shear: Hi! There!

8
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.379
hal shear: How! How are you?

9
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:52.530
John Day: I'm well, I just sent you an email on that hotel in Canada.

10
00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.080
hal shear: Yeah, I got it. Thank you. I sent you a note thanking you.

11
00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:00.349
John Day: How we know anything about it. It's just something that we saw

12
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:02.729
John Day: look like. It might be okay.

13
00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.239
hal shear: Yeah, that's fine.

14
00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:13.805
hal shear: Okay. Oh, it's just while where I was waiting I was seeing whether I could get a

15
00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.700
hal shear: a Pdf of the whole bill.

16
00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.339
hal shear: The big bat build back better, Bill.

17
00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:23.340
hal shear: Anyway.

18
00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.940
hal shear: Let's proceed.

19
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:34.649
John Day: Okay, so Saul won't be here, neither will Dave just yet.

20
00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.310
John Day: and I got a note from Jim to Natale, who said he's gonna drop out.

21
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.459
John Day: He's burnt out and

22
00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:46.060
John Day: So

23
00:03:48.153 --> 00:03:56.166
John Day: today I don't. I invited George. I don't know. I would. I hope he shows up because I would really like us to discuss

24
00:03:57.597 --> 00:04:03.171
John Day: Wednesday's events to see how everybody thought it went so

25
00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:09.289
John Day: we'll wait a little while and see? See if he if he does show up

26
00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:16.079
John Day: trying to get the transcript from it. But I'm not optimistic. When

27
00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:25.280
John Day: we, I mentioned it online as the meeting was closing, invested. Oh, Dom took care of that.

28
00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:33.392
John Day: So I called Dom. She didn't know anything about it. So I sent an email to both Beth and Sally, asking them to

29
00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.620
John Day: have somebody send me the transcript. But I'm not very optimistic. I they tend to.

30
00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.910
hal shear: You didn't ask. You didn't ask Ollie.

31
00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:42.670
John Day: What?

32
00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:44.289
hal shear: You didn't ask Ollie.

33
00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:48.720
John Day: Well, maybe the is he, the one who runs things behind the scenes.

34
00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.242
hal shear: Put this way.

35
00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:58.419
hal shear: Whenever there's that kind of an issue, he's the one he probably has access to all of it.

36
00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:59.340
John Day: I see.

37
00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.780
hal shear: I would.

38
00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:00.299
John Day: I see.

39
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.720
hal shear: Absolutely, ask him.

40
00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.478
John Day: So that's the back door to

41
00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:14.500
hal shear: And and they know he has it. So it's not like you're going behind their back or anything. So I.

42
00:05:14.745 --> 00:05:14.990
John Day: Right.

43
00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:22.170
hal shear: Say to him, you know, explain what happened, and that we really need that transcript

44
00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.919
hal shear: to do the analysis.

45
00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:29.765
John Day: Well, not only that it would occur to me it could be, I think, in general, those transcripts for this type of

46
00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:36.850
John Day: meeting could be very valuable, and one thing I intend to do is use the transcript

47
00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:44.899
John Day: to see if there are any new topics we should be putting on the Discussion Board.

48
00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:48.419
hal shear: Yes, I think it's I think it's very useful.

49
00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:55.516
John Day: Yeah, alright. I didn't think about I didn't make remember that connection with Ollie, but you're probably right, as

50
00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:01.310
John Day: I'm not sure what it is with with Beth and Sally, whether I mean they just don't seem to

51
00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:10.660
John Day: respond to anything that is but the very basic in having this meeting, you know.

52
00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:15.559
John Day: And I'm a little concerned actually in.

53
00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.609
John Day: Maybe we can include George. We should include George in this.

54
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:22.230
John Day: How they feel about all of a sudden having a

55
00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:30.110
John Day: discussion board to run the meeting. Are they happy with that? Or they feel that is an intrusion. I don't know.

56
00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:35.660
John Day: I we might as well talk about it now we're onto it.

57
00:06:36.327 --> 00:06:39.250
John Day: I thought it went pretty well, actually.

58
00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:48.332
John Day: And I thought there was a significant improvement in the focus of the meeting, because we had something to frame it, and

59
00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:54.819
hal shear: Yeah, I I absolutely positively agree.

60
00:06:54.940 --> 00:07:05.480
hal shear: And the example I would use would be the the book discussion we had today on Valley, which.

61
00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:12.770
hal shear: as you know, is run by Abby. And and it's

62
00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:17.309
hal shear: the thing is that they understand the topic

63
00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:30.139
hal shear: to the point where they could frame a couple of questions, and then, you know, there are 28 of us in the group, and you know people put up their their hands

64
00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:34.180
hal shear: on the chat, and

65
00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:45.030
hal shear: they can call on them, and then they, you know. So here you have an hour and a half in which we do a detailed look at the book, and

66
00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:56.900
hal shear: so many different ways. I mean, it's just terrific. And that's because it's organized and because they did so much pre work. But because the group

67
00:07:57.070 --> 00:08:00.209
hal shear: is willing to to deal with.

68
00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:00.620
John Day: Contribute.

69
00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:03.390
hal shear: Organization really important.

70
00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:09.350
John Day: I'm not sure you're gonna find a very apt or enthusiastic audience with Abby.

71
00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:15.900
John Day: I mean, I've been in the New Yorker discussion group for a couple of years, and

72
00:08:16.698 --> 00:08:23.990
John Day: I, behind the scenes, was trying to promote use of Chatbots.

73
00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:30.270
John Day: but I was very careful not to really talk about AI when I

74
00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:33.800
John Day: you know, with speaking, I moderated a couple of stories.

75
00:08:33.809 --> 00:08:34.449
hal shear: Yeah.

76
00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:36.149
John Day: And I just stayed away from it. But

77
00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:48.020
John Day: my, my strong sense there is that there is something between an aversion to having technology

78
00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:51.580
John Day: used to outright hostility.

79
00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:53.929
John Day: And I think there's a

80
00:08:54.070 --> 00:09:01.570
John Day: big misunderstanding of what you can and should be doing with AI. And I hear all the time. Oh, well, you know.

81
00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:08.366
John Day: might as well just have AI talking to AI, where you know it's gonna replace people. And so they're just kind of

82
00:09:09.417 --> 00:09:12.280
John Day: a a lot of missed opportunity.

83
00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:20.309
John Day: So let me relate a anecdote to you. That just happened yesterday, which it was I found quite interesting.

84
00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:31.380
John Day: I'm always. I like to read a lot of different things. And so I like to have something in hand that, you know might be literature history, so that I can switch between them.

85
00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:35.580
John Day: and I was looking for something to read yesterday and

86
00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:37.520
John Day: kind of thought. Well, you know.

87
00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:40.569
John Day: never really read anything by Faulkner.

88
00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:45.919
John Day: and I'll give it a try. So I jumped on on Amazon.

89
00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:52.329
John Day: and for 2 bucks I got a a collection of all his not, you know, his famous novels.

90
00:09:52.820 --> 00:10:01.129
John Day: and I started in with the as I lie dying.

91
00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:06.100
John Day: which is a famous book and right away I was drawn into it. It's it's very interesting

92
00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:13.763
John Day: bit difficult to read, he, he writes, in the stream of conscious mode in which

93
00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:17.969
John Day: The sentences tend to be fragmented.

94
00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:23.600
John Day: And they it's just hard to follow.

95
00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:27.630
John Day: and it's the school of of literature

96
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:33.570
John Day: that became very popular 20 years after Faulkner, called the Nouveau Houmont.

97
00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:37.420
John Day: where reality is kind of broken up into these little

98
00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:44.559
John Day: segments of things that we perceive, but not necessarily connected it, the more fragmented view of

99
00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:46.979
John Day: the world around us.

100
00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:49.730
John Day: But you know, it's a really interesting book.

101
00:10:50.130 --> 00:11:03.509
John Day: So I'm reading it. And it reminds me of other things that I've read. 1st of all, it reminds me of this book by Ag, the only one he ever wrote which is death in the family.

102
00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:10.862
John Day: Very interesting work, and it also reminded me of the

103
00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:19.720
John Day: play by Thornton wilder our town.

104
00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:34.549
John Day: So all of these works that yeah, I'm reading. As I lay dying

105
00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:44.609
John Day: I read the other 2 long time ago, multiple times, and they seem similar. So I wanna I wanna compare them as they go along. So I start prompting AI

106
00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.100
John Day: and I get some interesting results.

107
00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:52.059
John Day: And then I say, okay, I want to make this more direct because this is just using general knowledge.

108
00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:59.460
John Day: So I I you know, it took me 10 min to go find the text for these other works.

109
00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:07.230
John Day: and I put it into a Claude project. Let me share that with you because I thought the I found the interest the

110
00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:21.520
John Day: Okay?

111
00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:28.850
John Day: Oh, let me get organized here.

112
00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:38.020
John Day: Alright. So you see, the American trio of authors on the screen.

113
00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:39.686
hal shear: No, it's

114
00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:40.940
John Day: Tab.

115
00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.169
John Day: I did it wrong again. Hold on!

116
00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:47.750
John Day: Oh.

117
00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:02.060
John Day: how about now?

118
00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:03.420
hal shear: Better, yes.

119
00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:04.980
John Day: Oh, okay, fine.

120
00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:06.990
John Day: So

121
00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:12.340
John Day: hold on

122
00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:28.291
John Day: alright. So I started.

123
00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:33.900
John Day: Well, let me show you. Oh, actually, yeah, let me go back.

124
00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:39.440
John Day: What I did is, I took all 3 of those works, and I put it into the project. Knowledge.

125
00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:40.130
hal shear: Right.

126
00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:46.159
John Day: In the family, and our town.

127
00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:52.880
John Day: and the text from as I like. As I lay down.

128
00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:56.765
John Day: So I started asking the questions, and

129
00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:03.119
John Day: it was very interesting what I got, and then

130
00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:07.670
John Day: more and more, I find it very useful to use this visualization.

131
00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:15.209
John Day: So this 1st visualization is, I said, Okay, visualize the relationship between these works.

132
00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:23.610
John Day: And I get this graphic which made sense to me. I'm familiar with all the works.

133
00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:24.780
hal shear: Yup!

134
00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:30.519
John Day: And what else is that? As far as I did?

135
00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:35.209
John Day: Now, let's create a detailed comparison of the tones of these 3 works.

136
00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:38.930
John Day: and it does that for me.

137
00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:44.419
John Day: So. The scope of this is, you know, I think.

138
00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:48.129
John Day: quite remarkable, but it's jarring for a lot of people.

139
00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:54.000
John Day: The fact that I can take these 3 works

140
00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:57.390
John Day: that have a connection to one another

141
00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:09.550
John Day: and explore that using the you know, these simple prompts is, I think, quite impressive, and

142
00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:17.969
John Day: then to be able to visualize it is even more instructive or more interesting.

143
00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:29.739
John Day: one can imagine. And, in fact, I'm at some point I think I might like to teach a course like this. Take 3 something like this, maybe even this this example.

144
00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:42.170
John Day: But there's a big cultural challenge. A lot of people will just, I think.

145
00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:48.819
John Day: get their backup and say, Oh, no, this is not. This is not what we do. When we read literature. We, you know

146
00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:51.880
John Day: we we read something, and we talk.

147
00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:54.470
John Day: and they never get beyond that.

148
00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:56.200
John Day: So

149
00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:04.330
John Day: there are the possibilities, and there are the obstacles.

150
00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:11.860
hal shear: Yeah, I think the challenge. By the way, for my book group.

151
00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:16.310
hal shear: I had both chat, gpt, and quad do

152
00:16:16.795 --> 00:16:25.259
hal shear: some work for me which I could share. But the but the point is, I didn't get to the level of you did, because that wasn't

153
00:16:25.873 --> 00:16:34.969
hal shear: I didn't need to, because I knew that the discussion would be sufficiently involved, that it would get to the point.

154
00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:43.710
hal shear: But I think the big problem is, John, that there is so much disinformation, and and I don't mean

155
00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:47.749
hal shear: Well, some of it is purposeful, but

156
00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:51.500
hal shear: there is so much disinformation about

157
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:58.370
hal shear: the the what it means to use the AI. And I. And I think that

158
00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:13.939
hal shear: what I pointed out to the people that I'm involved with is that things are changing so dramatically that the general purpose stuff that before where it went out and got all kinds of things

159
00:17:14.415 --> 00:17:31.240
hal shear: that's gone. Those days are over as long as you're in one of the 3, and you put the prompts in properly, and you'll get the sources, etc, etc. And but I think that it's a real problem. As a matter of fact.

160
00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:34.660
hal shear: I don't know whether you get the New York Times, but.

161
00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:35.370
John Day: I do?

162
00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:39.740
hal shear: Did you get the the Sunday section on AI?

163
00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:42.770
hal shear: There was a whole magazine on AI.

164
00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:45.500
John Day: No, I didn't get that. I should go. I should.

165
00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:51.140
hal shear: Well you should look if you, assuming you have a subscription.

166
00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:52.530
John Day: I do?

167
00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:53.910
hal shear: Absolutely get it.

168
00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:56.169
John Day: Let me see if I can run it down here.

169
00:17:56.170 --> 00:18:01.072
hal shear: You have. It's back, I think, June. I actually have it for my

170
00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:04.859
John Day: Do you know what it's called? AI.

171
00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:08.019
hal shear: Yeah, it's called. It's the Sunday Magazine.

172
00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:11.769
hal shear: Why is that? Oh, give me an exact.

173
00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:38.390
hal shear: Alright.

174
00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:41.670
hal shear: Yeah, it's called the AI issue.

175
00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:47.369
hal shear: And it's it looks like this is the face of it.

176
00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:50.409
hal shear: and it doesn't have a date.

177
00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:53.890
hal shear: But it's alright.

178
00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:57.260
hal shear: That's June 20, second.

179
00:18:58.910 --> 00:18:59.870
John Day: All right.

180
00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:12.000
hal shear: And and what when you go through the articles, I'm actually found the article about kids.

181
00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:19.090
hal shear: And they're therapy possibilities

182
00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:22.059
hal shear: to be very interesting for my.

183
00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:25.210
hal shear: my, you know, 9 or 11 year old.

184
00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:31.300
hal shear: So yeah, you got it.

185
00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:35.229
hal shear: It's hard to find. You gotta go up here, I think.

186
00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:40.060
hal shear: Use the search for June 20, second.

187
00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:46.340
John Day: Yeah, you. If you've got the link, send it to me. But let's see. Now, I should be able to get to the magazine.

188
00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:46.960
hal shear: What?

189
00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:47.760
John Day: That, under.

190
00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:49.819
hal shear: Well, but it yeah, it's good.

191
00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:52.110
hal shear: But you got a fine magazine.

192
00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:53.540
John Day: I know.

193
00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:58.139
hal shear: But I think if you use the the

194
00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:03.480
hal shear: think about July 11, th the rules, the the spyglass.

195
00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:08.380
hal shear: You put it in there, and you'll probably get it easier.

196
00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:14.129
hal shear: I have a big problem with it, too, because it doesn't show the magazine as an option.

197
00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:17.099
John Day: Yeah, I know it's kind of scattered.

198
00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:19.331
hal shear: Yeah. So if you just use that

199
00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:24.060
hal shear: that little thing up in the corner, yeah, that's it.

200
00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:26.140
John Day: To put what in.

201
00:20:26.653 --> 00:20:27.680
hal shear: 20 second.

202
00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:30.100
John Day: June 20, second.

203
00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:35.020
hal shear: Yeah, 2,000.

204
00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:37.180
hal shear: Yeah. Well, that's it.

205
00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:40.280
John Day: Yeah, right.

206
00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:42.420
hal shear: Oh, just open that up.

207
00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:48.199
hal shear: I'll open up the Times in print for

208
00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:53.780
hal shear: either 1st one today's paper.

209
00:20:54.328 --> 00:20:58.050
hal shear: Open that up, and that should give you all the sections.

210
00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:00.640
John Day: Huh!

211
00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:04.609
John Day: I see I'm not familiar with this. But all right, let me.

212
00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:09.590
hal shear: Yeah, but no, we go. Yeah, go back up and you'll see the magazine.

213
00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:14.080
hal shear: If you were in the options somewhere.

214
00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:17.140
John Day: Magazine, all right.

215
00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:18.120
hal shear: There you go.

216
00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:21.185
hal shear: So there you are, the the

217
00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:26.670
John Day: Is this one the one everyone is using AI for? Everything. Is that bad.

218
00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:39.999
hal shear: Yeah. Well, I mean, these articles are all about AI. But yes, when you look at that you'll see that. It's really confusing, and people don't take the time to figure it out

219
00:21:40.661 --> 00:21:47.048
hal shear: and this is what they're reading. And so well remember, it's assuming that

220
00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:53.700
hal shear: they're reading the times. But you know.

221
00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:57.500
John Day: Anyway. June 16.th Yeah.

222
00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:03.230
John Day: So I mean, there, there are a lot of them. But was there one in particular? You were looking at.

223
00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:10.399
hal shear: The the one that that I'm using the most is the kids in crisis. Could Chatbot therapy help?

224
00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:14.429
hal shear: Because I think that that's a really important thing.

225
00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:15.270
John Day: I see.

226
00:22:15.808 --> 00:22:21.750
hal shear: But in terms of the of the general look.

227
00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:29.989
hal shear: I think that AI might take your job. AI is port. All those are interesting approaches.

228
00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:36.380
hal shear: And you know the part that was this, AI might take your job thing.

229
00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:50.990
hal shear: Point out that. Yes, some of the drudge stuff, whether it's legal or or whatever is, gonna go away. But you're gonna have other things like AI ethics.

230
00:22:51.270 --> 00:23:01.369
hal shear: which I think is a real important thing. And you know. I don't think people have thought about the fact that humans can

231
00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:12.209
hal shear: can add a connection here that AI doesn't up depreciate, and ethics, I think, is one example of that.

232
00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:16.870
hal shear: And I spent a lot of time studying ethics, bioethics and

233
00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:23.580
hal shear: in specific. So you know, I can see that it really makes a great deal of sense.

234
00:23:24.050 --> 00:23:29.460
hal shear: But in any event, all I'm saying is that I think that

235
00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:36.940
hal shear: those of us that know a little more, and you obviously know more than most people do. Certainly me

236
00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:44.879
hal shear: the somehow the phraseology and I. We talked about this in the session with George

237
00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:47.970
hal shear: I mean, I think, staying away from.

238
00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:51.640
hal shear: But triggers is useful.

239
00:23:51.750 --> 00:24:01.750
hal shear: and I don't know. You know I don't know how you do that because you're it's so inculcated with what you're doing, but somehow

240
00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:08.479
hal shear: we have to use language that makes people understand that

241
00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:15.250
hal shear: this is just another tool, and we have to use it and use it to benefit us.

242
00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:21.550
hal shear: And and it's not something that's gonna kill us and take jobs away. And all the rest of that

243
00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:31.859
hal shear: and so yes, yeah, in in a sense, you need to take the core a course to understand that for sure. But,

244
00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:40.200
hal shear: You know, I think the more we can do to get away from the the done

245
00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:43.330
hal shear: predicate that we use were better.

246
00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:50.160
hal shear: By the way, you see the Sunday the magazine right there, and the and that one

247
00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:53.440
hal shear: and the head and the headers underneath

248
00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:56.910
hal shear: at times print front, page, etc.

249
00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:59.150
hal shear: You see the magazine right there.

250
00:24:59.930 --> 00:25:00.739
John Day: Where is it now?

251
00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:04.679
hal shear: Right. See? Bring your your cursor down. That's it.

252
00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:07.539
hal shear: Yeah, I know. Now, now I know how to get to it.

253
00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:09.900
hal shear: Yeah. So that opens up the magazine.

254
00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:12.380
John Day: I should actually bookmark that.

255
00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:17.529
hal shear: Yeah, yeah, I think you'll find some interesting stuff in there. But

256
00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:23.222
hal shear: I think that and it but it's a a

257
00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:28.259
hal shear: It's a way to to have some subtlety.

258
00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:33.970
hal shear: People, you know again, so many people believe that

259
00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:42.469
hal shear: it's all crap what they find. And you know AI is just doesn't have any sense at all. You can't trust it, etc.

260
00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:53.229
hal shear: and you know, understand that you know the sources are now, provided. You can, in fact, look at the sources, and you could put your own sources in.

261
00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:59.180
hal shear: And I think those are the kinds of things that that people need to understand.

262
00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:02.099
John Day: You know, yeah, how you get. There was a.

263
00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:02.540
hal shear: Yeah. Man.

264
00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:03.529
John Day: In a quarter you.

265
00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:04.980
hal shear: Question, beyond that.

266
00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:17.250
John Day: So getting back to our current events group, I really like the way that this topic board was progressing, at least from my point of view. It looked really good because

267
00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:24.701
John Day: fairly low. On talking about AI, I mean, it was something that was out there

268
00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:31.259
John Day: and you know, if I were a really super duper good web

269
00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:35.980
John Day: developer, I could do that, but it would take me 10 times longer to do it.

270
00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:39.319
John Day: and maybe nobody would ask the question.

271
00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:44.870
John Day: So a short term goal for the group, if we can manage it.

272
00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:53.149
John Day: is to main in my mind, would be to maintain the top, you know the topic board to help drive up, drive the discussions.

273
00:26:53.340 --> 00:27:01.630
John Day: And then, as we're having the discussions, we could have these little diversions into what we've learned you know, with AI,

274
00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:08.459
John Day: and then get people more interested or more comfortable, I guess.

275
00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:15.310
John Day: So here's an here, here's an example of how that might work a little bit.

276
00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:22.559
John Day: There's this guy you ever heard of, Ace Mcglue?

277
00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:26.309
hal shear: Not seen that the name I don't know.

278
00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:29.580
John Day: He's he's an economist in Mit.

279
00:27:30.186 --> 00:27:35.209
John Day: and he just won the Nobel Prize in 2024.

280
00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:42.590
John Day: So he's, you know, a more than reasonable source.

281
00:27:42.910 --> 00:27:47.860
John Day: So what do you you got all these youtubes? Right?

282
00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:51.490
John Day: And people talk. You know, they the

283
00:27:52.980 --> 00:28:00.819
John Day: Youtube. So I watch this Youtube. I watch that Youtube. The problem is, you've got to listen to a lot of things before you get.

284
00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:03.569
hal shear: You're breaking up, John.

285
00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:10.720
John Day: What might be interesting to you right any better. Now hold on.

286
00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:11.790
hal shear: Yes.

287
00:28:23.150 --> 00:28:24.380
John Day: Can you hear me now?

288
00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:25.120
hal shear: Yes.

289
00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:26.300
John Day: Okay.

290
00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:32.220
John Day: So what I was saying is that the problem with you know, looking at these youtubes is that

291
00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:33.295
John Day: it?

292
00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:40.279
John Day: takes a long time you have to listen to a lot of things before you get to to the topic of interest.

293
00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:46.190
John Day: So what I had. Let's see if I still have this pub.

294
00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:47.580
hal shear: Oh!

295
00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:56.419
hal shear: You had the you had the the summary of it, and the key points.

296
00:28:57.220 --> 00:28:59.039
John Day: Yeah. Where'd it go?

297
00:28:59.190 --> 00:29:01.690
hal shear: Yeah, no, but I'm saying I'm sure you did that.

298
00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:07.560
John Day: Alright. So let me just demonstrate that I was. I just did it with Gemini

299
00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:15.580
John Day: recent.

300
00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:18.100
John Day: Alright.

301
00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:22.969
John Day: So the way this works who works best with Gemini is.

302
00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:45.199
John Day: I think this is you unique to Gemini at this point.

303
00:30:05.450 --> 00:30:06.420
John Day: Okay.

304
00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:17.050
John Day: so it does a transcription of the audio into text, and then it analyzes it.

305
00:30:17.150 --> 00:30:20.500
John Day: and then you you can't. And then it has references

306
00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:24.360
John Day: to the section that it's referring to.

307
00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:25.350
hal shear: Exactly.

308
00:30:25.610 --> 00:30:32.450
John Day: So now you can turn all a lot of these Youtubes into things that you can interrogate.

309
00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:45.390
John Day: So with some amount of scale acquisition, people could

310
00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:48.769
John Day: look at a lot more a lot more effectively.

311
00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:58.639
John Day: But there's most of our cohort. Our fellow senior citizens are stuck

312
00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:05.310
John Day: with habits that they've had, you know, for a long time

313
00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:12.859
John Day: you go online, you find something you like. You read it, you think about it, and you make notes about it. And that's it.

314
00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:19.059
John Day: There's no way of being more systematic about getting at the information.

315
00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:26.070
John Day: So a lot of the discussions that we have, I think, tend to be anecdotal.

316
00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:33.039
John Day: Some people have better memories than others, and they, you know, Alan Nemeth has an excellent

317
00:31:33.666 --> 00:31:41.200
John Day: command of the fax, and that's always very useful, but for the amount of

318
00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:52.510
John Day: information that we've got to work through on some of these complex issues, a way to accelerate

319
00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:58.460
John Day: the acquisition of the essential points. The salient points is of great value.

320
00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:02.170
John Day: and it's all it is here at hand. But people have to

321
00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:10.395
John Day: be able to work in a different mode, and I'm not sure how we

322
00:32:11.390 --> 00:32:14.669
John Day: we get there. I think a bit about this, because.

323
00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:21.779
John Day: given what I've done so far with teaching the courses and trying to

324
00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:25.179
John Day: enable people to be able to use AI.

325
00:32:25.690 --> 00:32:30.800
John Day: I come back frequently to the issue that

326
00:32:31.090 --> 00:32:37.500
John Day: some people, most people, I would say, have challenges

327
00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:51.099
John Day: with just interfacing with the browser and moving around when we 1st started, you had some issues, but I think we've worked through. Most of those was difficult. Because we were doing it remote.

328
00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:58.280
John Day: So I think there's a layer in this that is just the mechanics.

329
00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:03.610
John Day: How do you switch windows around? How do you make bookmarks.

330
00:33:03.870 --> 00:33:07.109
John Day: How do you download, upload that sort of thing?

331
00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:11.970
John Day: And one of the things that I'm considering.

332
00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:17.437
John Day: Yeah, I'm on this strategic planning committee. So it'll give me some. It'll give me

333
00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:28.760
John Day: An opportunity to suggest doing new things is to offer some nontraditional courses

334
00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:35.289
John Day: at Bali, and and I would call these boot camp for AI,

335
00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:41.030
John Day: and I think there could be an addition for political science.

336
00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:47.009
John Day: for tech medical technology in addition, for even literature, perhaps.

337
00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:59.980
John Day: and the approach that I would take is to focus 1st on just how you use the browser

338
00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:08.199
John Day: that you have, whether it is chrome or safari

339
00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:15.710
John Day: to access information to move around, make windows, and do all the things that you and I went through.

340
00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:17.400
John Day: but

341
00:34:17.639 --> 00:34:23.309
John Day: I think the right way to do that rather than trying to do it remotely is to do it in person.

342
00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:26.929
John Day: So I would imagine a series of

343
00:34:29.449 --> 00:34:36.130
John Day: sessions where we would all confer, and you know we all would get together at

344
00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:40.309
John Day: Turner Street. I think they have facilities to do this.

345
00:34:40.530 --> 00:34:44.519
John Day: The advantage is that when you have a problem, a person has a problem.

346
00:34:44.929 --> 00:34:55.429
John Day: The facilitator, me can walk over to the computer and resolve it much more quickly than try to talk through the issues over the screen. That becomes very, very difficult.

347
00:34:55.989 --> 00:35:03.060
John Day: so the progression would be building, and I gotta think through this, but building certain capabilities

348
00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:20.029
John Day: on being able to establish a window, make a bookmark a a folder with bookmarks in it, and then get to some information, download it, and then we're ready to access a chat, bot, upload it to the chat bot and analyze it.

349
00:35:21.010 --> 00:35:30.859
John Day: So let's establish the skills and then see what we can do with the skills in terms of

350
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:34.300
John Day: using chatbots

351
00:35:34.570 --> 00:35:41.169
John Day: all the previous courses I've given have been general. I've tried to get something in in terms of subject matter.

352
00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:50.280
John Day: I've tried to get something in there on literature and science and history and current events.

353
00:35:50.570 --> 00:35:54.870
John Day: And the problem with that is, it's it's, I think, probably too diffuse.

354
00:35:57.820 --> 00:36:03.480
John Day: So what this would be is focusing more on

355
00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:06.630
John Day: the mechanics of what you do

356
00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:16.809
John Day: with examples for a particular area of interest. Like current events. There could be boot camp for, you know AI boot camp for for current current events.

357
00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:25.499
John Day: and finally, one of the I think, in the long term, one of the big advantages or one of the opportunities

358
00:36:25.730 --> 00:36:38.520
John Day: is to be able to give or conduct a class from a facility that is

359
00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:46.660
John Day: set up for both in person and remote access.

360
00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:49.739
John Day: The technology has come a long way.

361
00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:53.359
John Day: And in Lexington, for example.

362
00:36:54.270 --> 00:37:00.440
John Day: at the Lexington Compute the Lexington Community Center they have 4 rooms that are set up like that.

363
00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:07.419
John Day: I gave a talk at the Lexington Computer Technology group in such a room. And it was very good.

364
00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:13.820
John Day: So you can have people either in person or

365
00:37:15.149 --> 00:37:19.100
John Day: if they're more comfortable with what they're doing, they could be remote.

366
00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:27.249
John Day: I think that that is something that's probably going to be a big thing in Bali's future.

367
00:37:27.430 --> 00:37:29.690
John Day: having, you know, within this

368
00:37:30.278 --> 00:37:36.181
John Day: planning group. Everybody agrees with that. It's just how do you? How do you get there?

369
00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:52.480
John Day: some of the big issues that the the volley is facing is being in this antiquated Turner building that they want to shut down. And where are they gonna go next. And Brandeis is under a lot of duress financially right now. So it's not a good time to be

370
00:37:53.010 --> 00:38:03.610
John Day: asking for, you know, upgrades and any sort of thing, so lot of barriers to get there. But I think this is the way that it would work extremely well. And

371
00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:08.650
John Day: for my point I can imagine in the future giving a course where.

372
00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:10.699
John Day: So it's a 5 week course

373
00:38:11.010 --> 00:38:22.170
John Day: to you know. Maybe all of them would be in this hybrid mode. I would be willing to do that drive over to Brandeis, but the people who are actually

374
00:38:22.350 --> 00:38:27.359
John Day: taking the course could either take it from their home, if it's more convenient.

375
00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:32.139
John Day: or if they want, they could come to the facility for the hands on.

376
00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:39.610
John Day: Now that might be a little bit particular to the sort of thing that I do, but I could see that might be useful in lots of other areas.

377
00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:42.090
John Day: I think we're

378
00:38:42.330 --> 00:38:49.839
John Day: of course I'm heavy in heavily focused on technology. And I think there's a lot of advantages.

379
00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:56.470
John Day: But there's a big, practical aspect of that, a lot of courses. I take the

380
00:38:57.371 --> 00:39:00.499
John Day: study group leader doesn't use any visual aids.

381
00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:02.040
John Day: It's all oral.

382
00:39:02.430 --> 00:39:06.970
John Day: And I think that's a big missed opportunity.

383
00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:09.139
John Day: I mean, you know, you just

384
00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:16.630
John Day: you read this, and we'll talk about it, and it's all restricted to

385
00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:19.939
John Day: how much I can remember about what somebody has said.

386
00:39:20.610 --> 00:39:24.290
John Day: and the last period of time, or earlier in in the course.

387
00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:31.740
John Day: And very. I think very few Sdls have visual aids.

388
00:39:32.010 --> 00:39:36.749
John Day: and a lot of that is because they don't. A lot of them just don't have the skills to

389
00:39:37.572 --> 00:39:41.459
John Day: use, you know, to put up those visual aids.

390
00:39:41.710 --> 00:39:47.606
John Day: So kind of a big, complicated problem with the

391
00:39:50.350 --> 00:39:54.800
John Day: So shall we say digital fluency being

392
00:39:55.820 --> 00:40:02.479
John Day: at the foundation of a lot of it? And I I think if we're gonna move forward and get an adaptation of

393
00:40:04.264 --> 00:40:09.070
John Day: a widespread adaptation of of AI in our study.

394
00:40:09.610 --> 00:40:17.170
John Day: and to improve the quality of the presentation, we have to solve this digital fluency problem. So what are your thoughts.

395
00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:24.700
hal shear: Well, I mean, I agree with you. On the other hand.

396
00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:27.499
hal shear: I think you have to be very careful

397
00:40:27.890 --> 00:40:34.789
hal shear: with how you articulate it. So, for example, if you said.

398
00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:47.150
hal shear: I'm going to give a course, or I'm gonna show Sgl's how to visualize things, so that

399
00:40:47.828 --> 00:40:56.610
hal shear: they would, that would be an addition to just reading something and saving the copy.

400
00:40:56.810 --> 00:41:06.120
hal shear: I'm not saying it perfectly, but the whole idea would be how to make the course more

401
00:41:06.749 --> 00:41:13.200
hal shear: impactful successful. Whatever, however, you want to. Characterize it, the the

402
00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:16.990
hal shear: that would not have anything to do with AI per se.

403
00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:24.120
hal shear: It would it would have to do with? Here are some tools that you can use to visualize

404
00:41:25.279 --> 00:41:30.474
hal shear: the material, and you could show

405
00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:43.050
hal shear: in political science, for example, or whatever you know, whichever thing you chose, you could say, here's what it would look like it, and I think that way

406
00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:56.909
hal shear: you could overcome some of the the reluctance to do anything digital quote unquote. I think that you really need to

407
00:41:57.110 --> 00:41:58.020
hal shear: to

408
00:41:58.150 --> 00:42:10.729
hal shear: move people away from thinking that. Yeah, we gotta worry about, you know, bookmarks and all that. Yes, they do. But it's in the context of

409
00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:16.629
hal shear: trying to make the the educational experience better.

410
00:42:17.350 --> 00:42:23.239
hal shear: And I think that you have. I think it's a great example that the

411
00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:26.920
hal shear: the example you have on the screen

412
00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:40.259
hal shear: is a great example. But and and I think that the the the issue would be how to how to present the problem in a way that

413
00:42:40.430 --> 00:42:42.369
hal shear: people can understand.

414
00:42:42.690 --> 00:42:49.939
hal shear: And so I think that's that. That's the crucial thing. And so if if the strategic

415
00:42:50.080 --> 00:43:04.689
hal shear: or turns out to say yes, we have to make sure that we have these technology tools in our toolbox so that we can teach and learn better.

416
00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:07.689
hal shear: I think that's going to be a very tough sell.

417
00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:21.759
hal shear: I think it just. You have to work backwards from saying one of the things we're trying to do is to improve our ability to retain the the

418
00:43:21.950 --> 00:43:30.859
hal shear: material from our our sessions, and one way to do that is to use the visualization, etc.

419
00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:36.290
hal shear: Oh, I'm sorry. I don't mean to to rant, but.

420
00:43:36.290 --> 00:43:48.500
John Day: No, no, that's it that we're we're, you know. We're talking through this. And it's important to get different perspectives in here. I'm trying to get a you know, nucleus of a team that can, you know, help.

421
00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:48.980
hal shear: Right.

422
00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:57.139
John Day: Think through this. So I I agree with everything you said it. It's a matter of the emphasis and how you get there. For example

423
00:43:57.340 --> 00:44:03.509
John Day: I've come to be. I've come to use these launch pads a lot.

424
00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:04.820
hal shear: Yup!

425
00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:09.539
John Day: And the idea here is to put essentially everything you need for the course

426
00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:14.770
John Day: on the launch pad. I can do that or links to it.

427
00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:20.029
John Day: So for the very, very beginners.

428
00:44:21.390 --> 00:44:23.859
John Day: all you gotta do is get them this one

429
00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:28.889
John Day: reference and have them bookmark. One thing.

430
00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:33.940
John Day: and then, as the course goes on, I can change things

431
00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:42.289
John Day: on this one, you know, on this one page. Just keep it very, very simple. So if you were giving a course. Say you have some

432
00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:44.440
John Day: general information here.

433
00:44:45.958 --> 00:44:49.449
John Day: And there could be a week, one down here.

434
00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:57.140
John Day: and then the next week there could be a week, 2, and then if you click on that, you would go to the set of

435
00:44:57.796 --> 00:45:04.030
John Day: visuals that you're going to use for week one. So I think one of the things that keeps

436
00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:20.960
John Day: the most Sgls from actually developing a website is that the recommended approach to that

437
00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:28.249
John Day: is to use the Google product of presentations, or I, I forget what it's called.

438
00:45:28.570 --> 00:45:29.260
hal shear: Yup!

439
00:45:29.260 --> 00:45:38.809
John Day: And you know I'm comfortable with that. That's you know. That's fine. But for a lot of people they don't, you know. I've heard them say, Oh, you know I can't do that, you know this is, you know, this is awful.

440
00:45:38.990 --> 00:45:43.889
John Day: and it does require, for you know they just can't get off the ground.

441
00:45:44.850 --> 00:45:51.600
John Day: So how we're I'm just coming at this in a different angle.

442
00:45:51.790 --> 00:45:59.470
John Day: How can we facilitate? Let's focus on the Sdls. Now, how can we facilitate getting them the information

443
00:45:59.690 --> 00:46:05.620
John Day: that they might use if it were in the appropriate format.

444
00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:09.139
John Day: and they get it to them so that they can conveniently use it.

445
00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:13.889
John Day: So something like, if I were working with somebody to create a course.

446
00:46:14.380 --> 00:46:20.469
John Day: And we agreed that, okay, week, one is, gonna have this type of visual is, you know, these things that I need to talk about.

447
00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:26.449
John Day: We could quickly create the visualizations that they need

448
00:46:27.050 --> 00:46:32.009
John Day: and put a link in here in this launch pad so that they could get to them.

449
00:46:32.170 --> 00:46:37.939
John Day: And I think with a little bit of work they could. You know, master, that

450
00:46:39.577 --> 00:46:47.600
John Day: reasonably well. And I think that that may be a point where this

451
00:46:47.850 --> 00:46:54.369
John Day: effort that we've got going, which is focused a lot on Project 2025, but in general could be very helpful.

452
00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:58.469
John Day: There are a lot of things that we're doing, information that

453
00:46:58.770 --> 00:47:05.690
John Day: if we made available to these Sgls

454
00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:11.740
John Day: and facilitated them, getting their hands on, you know, being able to access it

455
00:47:11.890 --> 00:47:18.170
John Day: and bringing it on a screen in a very, very simplified manner.

456
00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:40.189
John Day: We might get more uptake on acclamation to improving the level of instruction with better visuals, and then

457
00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:56.009
John Day: by slow degrees get into what goes on behind the scenes, because you may say, Okay, I need a visualization for this. Well, how do you get that? And and we might get online with them for a a 30 min session and say, Okay, let's

458
00:47:56.170 --> 00:48:05.020
John Day: here's what we do with. You know, Claude, to look at. You know this document you want to talk about or set of documents you want to talk about. And here's how we visualize it.

459
00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:11.379
John Day: and then we work with them and show them how that, you know how how that comes about.

460
00:48:12.210 --> 00:48:18.180
John Day: and then make it available to them. Let me let me give you a case in point. Here I I talked about this.

461
00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:23.350
John Day: I think a couple of weeks ago when Saul was here. And it's probably

462
00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:28.029
John Day: it was a bit of a mind, Bender, because it's in a totally different area.

463
00:48:29.250 --> 00:48:36.771
John Day: But I'm gonna I just wanna show you the content for it, or that's on the

464
00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:45.500
John Day: Got another launch pad here, chance and necessity launch pad.

465
00:48:46.050 --> 00:48:49.973
John Day: So this is a really important book that was written in the

466
00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:52.280
John Day: 1970.

467
00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:56.739
John Day: And this guy, Jacques Mano Nobel Laureate in chemistry.

468
00:48:56.940 --> 00:49:02.220
John Day: He's right up there with Maxwell Einstein Planck.

469
00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:08.740
John Day: The work that he did was just so fundamentally insightful.

470
00:49:09.450 --> 00:49:10.803
John Day: And he

471
00:49:12.820 --> 00:49:14.140
John Day: Oh, here I'll show you.

472
00:49:14.850 --> 00:49:18.699
John Day: I've been reading the book a Pdf version of the book

473
00:49:19.490 --> 00:49:21.250
John Day: for the last couple of weeks.

474
00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:32.983
John Day: and what I've been doing is creating a data visual Directory lots and lots of data visuals. Let me find. So this isn't all complete. But

475
00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:42.989
John Day: Oh, sequencing mono visualization.

476
00:49:46.820 --> 00:49:50.639
hal shear: You passed it. It was back up below where you are now.

477
00:49:50.850 --> 00:49:51.690
John Day: What?

478
00:49:51.690 --> 00:49:54.779
hal shear: It's below where you are. Now. Keep going down.

479
00:49:56.680 --> 00:49:58.010
John Day: Going down.

480
00:49:58.010 --> 00:50:00.859
hal shear: Yes, you're going up now. Go back, down.

481
00:50:03.050 --> 00:50:06.740
John Day: I'm looking for a particular visualization. Let me see if I can find it.

482
00:50:12.570 --> 00:50:14.111
John Day: Some of it gets pretty.

483
00:50:22.130 --> 00:50:24.119
John Day: Oh, okay, I think this is it?

484
00:50:25.260 --> 00:50:26.510
John Day: Yep, there it is.

485
00:50:27.910 --> 00:50:33.422
John Day: So this was the result of, you know, doing a query and and looking into

486
00:50:35.870 --> 00:50:38.660
John Day: the book, chance and necessity.

487
00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:54.340
John Day: So this is the type of visualization that can be readily created for use.

488
00:50:57.890 --> 00:50:59.039
John Day: Can it give

489
00:50:59.250 --> 00:51:09.829
John Day: the? You know you'd have to work with the Sgl. Show them the visualization, see? If you know they understand, or they like the way it flows, and fairly easy to change it.

490
00:51:10.580 --> 00:51:17.620
John Day: and then they could use it as a guide when they're talking.

491
00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:19.530
John Day: Okay.

492
00:51:20.460 --> 00:51:23.719
John Day: So we don't have to necessarily get into the content here. But

493
00:51:29.550 --> 00:51:34.070
hal shear: But yeah, but let me point out something, John.

494
00:51:34.250 --> 00:51:35.450
hal shear: Yeah.

495
00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:44.190
hal shear: The assumption is that we are gonna change the oh.

496
00:51:45.180 --> 00:51:56.570
hal shear: both the substance and the no, we're going to keep the substance the same. But we're going to change the format of our learning process.

497
00:51:56.970 --> 00:52:03.459
hal shear: And that's the under the assumption that what we're doing now is

498
00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:10.900
hal shear: not as useful to pass the characters in Bali as it could be.

499
00:52:11.250 --> 00:52:26.079
hal shear: so that that on the in the strategic session question is, how do we advance to the next level to make sure that as many people as possible get the maximum benefit from each course.

500
00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:44.759
hal shear: and, in fact that has to do with the Sgl's both picking the course and then creating the this. This kind of content visualization, the wrong word. But this presentation.

501
00:52:44.990 --> 00:52:50.559
hal shear: and and I think that it would be better

502
00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:57.160
hal shear: to show an example from an existing course which has been taught.

503
00:52:57.310 --> 00:52:59.579
hal shear: you know, 4 or 5 times

504
00:52:59.850 --> 00:53:06.380
hal shear: and use. Take that where you have all the data you have. The 10 classes

505
00:53:07.037 --> 00:53:23.749
hal shear: have been recorded. You have all the information, and you could show the Sgl. Using a good example, show an Sgl how it could look with some what you would call minor involvement.

506
00:53:23.890 --> 00:53:27.270
hal shear: And all of a sudden you could see the benefit of this.

507
00:53:27.650 --> 00:53:32.319
hal shear: and I think that would be the best way to both

508
00:53:32.780 --> 00:53:51.960
hal shear: from a strategic point of view, but also from a practical point of view. When you get down to the how do you convince people? Because we have that? I mean, I you know I was thinking of of Lois's ban the books course she's taught it, I think 3 times she's teaching it again

509
00:53:52.090 --> 00:54:03.999
hal shear: in the fall, and you have all that that entire course is available for you to to analyze and present.

510
00:54:04.210 --> 00:54:06.109
hal shear: And she's no dummy.

511
00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:13.920
hal shear: although she, you know, clear she didn't want to be as involved. And I don't know. You know she had a lot of other things going on.

512
00:54:14.030 --> 00:54:28.599
hal shear: But I don't think she has any particular problem with AI or technology at all, but I think showing her what it would look like would be really a good way to do it.

513
00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:37.800
John Day: Okay. I think we're very much talking along the same lines.

514
00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:38.510
hal shear: Good.

515
00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:54.010
John Day: So here, is something I did, following our conversation with Saul.

516
00:54:56.140 --> 00:55:00.220
John Day: And I created this deep research.

517
00:55:05.060 --> 00:55:06.420
John Day: And there's the

518
00:55:10.110 --> 00:55:18.450
John Day: there is the oh, actually, no! This is the this is the wrong one, the one.

519
00:55:19.100 --> 00:55:20.610
John Day: Give me a minute here.

520
00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:28.270
John Day: Yeah.

521
00:55:38.920 --> 00:55:40.969
John Day: Actually, I didn't. I? Just

522
00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:46.670
John Day: I move that up already.

523
00:55:57.820 --> 00:55:59.789
John Day: Too many loose threads here.

524
00:55:59.790 --> 00:56:01.230
hal shear: Yeah, no, I understand.

525
00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:08.790
John Day: I don't wanna want. I don't wanna end our session without having talked about.

526
00:56:08.790 --> 00:56:09.270
John Day: Sure.

527
00:56:09.270 --> 00:56:09.989
hal shear: What we're going to.

528
00:56:09.990 --> 00:56:12.759
John Day: Yeah, let's just do this, and then we'll, I'll move on.

529
00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:20.989
John Day: Yeah, I found the link. So this came out of the things that we were, and right along the line that you were just talking.

530
00:56:22.220 --> 00:56:28.059
John Day: This was Saul's discussion of why people vote against their own interest.

531
00:56:28.060 --> 00:56:28.810
hal shear: Right.

532
00:56:29.210 --> 00:56:36.810
John Day: And so based upon some, you know, pretty minimal

533
00:56:37.491 --> 00:56:45.159
John Day: input from him, I was able to create this type of economic or this type of dashboard.

534
00:56:46.290 --> 00:56:51.032
John Day: So what I wanted to do with Saul. So you know, this was a case history or

535
00:56:51.820 --> 00:56:57.540
John Day: a use case that I wanted to probe in the ways that you're talking about is.

536
00:56:58.190 --> 00:57:14.070
John Day: how would you use this in a course, Saul? Is this right? If it's not, we can adjust it, and I wanted to use him as a real time. Live guinea pig as we as he moves through his course, and I would be interested in finding. You know Lois would be great. You know she wanted to engage with us.

537
00:57:14.779 --> 00:57:20.780
John Day: I think you're absolutely right. We have to kind of work our way through this, but

538
00:57:20.900 --> 00:57:27.740
John Day: and a couple of demonstrations would be extremely appropriate. Right.

539
00:57:28.270 --> 00:57:38.739
hal shear: Yeah, and I would just I would stay away from I mean, I would make sure one of the demonstrations had nothing to do with mathematics or science

540
00:57:39.820 --> 00:57:47.220
hal shear: it it that it was like. And I've just used band of books, because, it's a

541
00:57:47.360 --> 00:58:04.080
hal shear: fairly straightforward course. But you know it's very complicated. In terms of geography and political. All the yeah. I think it's a terrific subject, but I think it could be enhanced by this kind of work and

542
00:58:04.650 --> 00:58:08.290
hal shear: and I think that that would show

543
00:58:08.420 --> 00:58:16.719
hal shear: most effectively what you can do. This challenge with Saul's course is that it's a dense course. To begin with.

544
00:58:16.910 --> 00:58:17.399
John Day: Oh, yeah.

545
00:58:17.400 --> 00:58:35.799
hal shear: Right. And so the only people that take that course, I think, are people that are really deeply into it. And I'll bet that he doesn't get, you know, 50 people in that course. He's probably getting 8 or 10 or 12 right.

546
00:58:36.420 --> 00:58:37.899
John Day: That's a good point. I'm.

547
00:58:37.900 --> 00:58:45.309
hal shear: You know, you just have to. If if you're gonna make some assumptions about the group of members

548
00:58:45.490 --> 00:58:48.689
hal shear: in general, I think that

549
00:58:49.202 --> 00:59:07.370
hal shear: you have to kind of go where they are. I agree with you, I mean, I think this is I mean, I don't. I don't know the detail of any of this, but this is a great way to present it, because it is a subject which is really important. And

550
00:59:07.877 --> 00:59:22.229
hal shear: you know whether it's a cultural identity or whether it's geography or whatever. There's lots of ways that you can look at this. And we've got to do more looking because it's in front of us, right

551
00:59:22.450 --> 00:59:27.630
hal shear: to the 26 election, the 28 election. Those are big deals.

552
00:59:27.830 --> 00:59:29.100
hal shear: Anybody.

553
00:59:29.750 --> 00:59:33.759
John Day: Alright. So you know, Lois, you can, you know certainly.

554
00:59:35.340 --> 00:59:39.650
John Day: Talk to her about whether she would like to

555
00:59:40.580 --> 00:59:47.230
John Day: work with us to you! That's the that's the course you were you were talking about right.

556
00:59:48.210 --> 00:59:48.840
hal shear: Yeah.

557
00:59:49.990 --> 00:59:58.530
John Day: Ask her if she wants to work with us, to help her create visuals

558
00:59:58.940 --> 01:00:02.180
John Day: that might be helpful for her or her. Her course.

559
01:00:02.530 --> 01:00:07.019
hal shear: Yeah. But I think the way you have to characterize it is to say,

560
01:00:07.570 --> 01:00:31.529
hal shear: lowest. We're in process of of working on a lot of Bali strategic things going forward, and one of which is to help Sgls with some tools that can make it a A more useful course for the participants

561
01:00:31.810 --> 01:00:33.490
hal shear: as opposed to

562
01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:40.149
hal shear: you know. How how can you make it? I mean, have to kind of that. That would be my my personal approach.

563
01:00:41.325 --> 01:00:42.130
hal shear: And

564
01:00:42.290 --> 01:00:50.130
hal shear: you know I don't think she's alone. I mean, there are other people that that are that, you know do the same courses

565
01:00:50.670 --> 01:00:51.090
hal shear: over.

566
01:00:51.090 --> 01:00:56.629
John Day: Well, that that's fine. I I'm just suggesting. Since you've got a you've taken a course from her.

567
01:00:56.630 --> 01:01:06.920
hal shear: But see the the I'll give you another example, and that's Ollie. Okay, now, Ollie isn't about as technically astute as one can be.

568
01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:13.170
hal shear: but he's never used. I mean, he creates a website for his course, and yes,

569
01:01:14.330 --> 01:01:20.480
hal shear: you know you can delve into it, but I don't think he's used this, and he be.

570
01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:21.370
John Day: That's probably true.

571
01:01:21.670 --> 01:01:29.470
hal shear: Another example of a person to see whether they know he's probably in your strategy group, anyway, right.

572
01:01:29.470 --> 01:01:30.160
John Day: He is.

573
01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:37.250
hal shear: Yes, so I mean, I think that he's an example. But he's we taught a course.

574
01:01:37.410 --> 01:01:43.230
hal shear: I've over and over again. I think he this even this Jfk, course he's doing which I'm

575
01:01:43.350 --> 01:01:48.059
hal shear: signed up for. Whether I'll get in or not I don't know. He's done it before.

576
01:01:48.210 --> 01:01:52.419
hal shear: so you know he's got the whole thing laid out already.

577
01:01:53.101 --> 01:01:59.690
hal shear: Now he's updating it for that to that. But still he'd be a perfect example.

578
01:01:59.830 --> 01:02:13.059
hal shear: and he's respected by the I think, by people in general, so he would be a really good. In fact, I the more I think about it, I think he'd be the perfect example.

579
01:02:13.490 --> 01:02:16.140
hal shear: perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect example.

580
01:02:16.610 --> 01:02:23.919
John Day: So why don't we do this? Let's think about this and identify a couple of candidates, Lois Ally.

581
01:02:24.220 --> 01:02:27.829
John Day: and then invite them to a Friday meeting to just

582
01:02:28.010 --> 01:02:31.920
John Day: to discuss what the opportunities are.

583
01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:35.110
John Day: and if they would like to proceed.

584
01:02:35.970 --> 01:02:36.790
John Day: Okay.

585
01:02:37.470 --> 01:02:38.110
hal shear: Yeah.

586
01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:40.150
John Day: Does that sound, reasonable.

587
01:02:40.310 --> 01:02:45.860
hal shear: Yeah, let me look at the at the oh.

588
01:02:46.770 --> 01:02:53.409
hal shear: at the the courses and and instructors, and see if I have any others that I would suggest.

589
01:02:53.410 --> 01:03:00.280
John Day: Yeah, right? You know, 3 or 4 would be, I think, fine if we got started with just one or 2 of them.

590
01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:06.749
John Day: That would be extremely that'd be a good step forward.

591
01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:07.190
hal shear: Yeah.

592
01:03:07.190 --> 01:03:10.960
John Day: So for other people. In the more general

593
01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:25.109
John Day: context of 2025, you had mentioned several times that you thought Steve Klein might be a good person to, or would be interested in attending you. Do you want to extend an invitation to him for one of our meetings?

594
01:03:25.650 --> 01:03:38.109
hal shear: Yeah, I think that. There's another example of somebody who's interested enough in it, and is technically sophisticated enough that he could be another

595
01:03:38.220 --> 01:03:43.249
hal shear: a very good person, and I'm happy to talk to him about that.

596
01:03:43.250 --> 01:03:44.669
John Day: Yeah. So why don't you put it forth?

597
01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:48.160
John Day: A lot of this depends upon personal relationships

598
01:03:48.850 --> 01:04:00.479
John Day: getting people, you know, comfortable and and willing to try something new. But if we get 2 or 3 people that we could shepherd through and show definitive, you know, positive results.

599
01:04:01.248 --> 01:04:05.660
John Day: That would be a step forward.

600
01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:12.320
hal shear: And I think I think the key is gonna be like, keep it badge.

601
01:04:14.270 --> 01:04:17.029
hal shear: as untechnical as we can make it

602
01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:22.750
hal shear: such that people don't think they have to be you know.

603
01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:29.310
hal shear: involved in every single thing. The beauty of your work is that

604
01:04:29.620 --> 01:04:36.310
hal shear: you've done the underlying. Forget. What if it's true underlying coding

605
01:04:36.420 --> 01:04:48.069
hal shear: that allows this thing to be produced. So it's not like they have to do that, have a format that people can turn to. And I think that's really important.

606
01:04:48.070 --> 01:04:50.650
John Day: If you found me out how I'm the

607
01:04:52.130 --> 01:04:56.230
John Day: I'm the architect under this, and figuring out how to do this.

608
01:04:56.230 --> 01:05:02.199
hal shear: Yeah, I think it's brilliant. I think it's absolutely stunning.

609
01:05:02.740 --> 01:05:03.760
hal shear: Okay.

610
01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:06.870
John Day: That's how we proceed. So here's the file you sent me.

611
01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:13.420
hal shear: Yup, okay, so here's the work I did.

612
01:05:13.540 --> 01:05:15.460
hal shear: And

613
01:05:16.008 --> 01:05:24.950
hal shear: and in order to get the numbers I had to put once next to the next to the article, so I could sum it up and I.

614
01:05:24.950 --> 01:05:25.359
John Day: Oh, yeah.

615
01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:29.649
hal shear: Instead, I decided not to worry so much about

616
01:05:29.830 --> 01:05:34.559
hal shear: contributors and and and authors, because

617
01:05:35.100 --> 01:05:43.909
hal shear: that's much less important than the actual people that are involved and what they've done. So if you go to the bottom, you'll see we now have

618
01:05:44.377 --> 01:05:50.450
hal shear: I don't know whether it's 140 or something. If you move down the bottom of that

619
01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:52.470
hal shear: screen all the way to Z,

620
01:05:56.340 --> 01:06:02.219
hal shear: yeah. 141 mandate for leadership folks

621
01:06:02.350 --> 01:06:04.839
hal shear: who are involved in the administration.

622
01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:10.500
hal shear: So now, the fact is.

623
01:06:11.082 --> 01:06:19.220
hal shear: my skill in in in presentation is not sophisticated enough to organize this in a way that

624
01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:31.609
hal shear: that is useful, I mean, right now. I just did it alphabetically, because I wanted to make sure everything was right. But technically what we should be doing, I think is

625
01:06:32.282 --> 01:06:47.560
hal shear: linking them the combining them in some way that makes sense. Whether it's Cabinet secretaries, deputies, I don't know. You know. It's up, you know. I I think it's it just has to be done

626
01:06:47.740 --> 01:06:49.589
hal shear: in order that we can.

627
01:06:51.700 --> 01:06:52.410
hal shear: Oh.

628
01:06:59.830 --> 01:07:04.120
John Day: So download

629
01:07:08.550 --> 01:07:10.550
John Day: alright. So that's on there.

630
01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:11.600
hal shear: Okay.

631
01:07:12.250 --> 01:07:13.250
John Day: So

632
01:07:27.850 --> 01:07:34.970
John Day: visualize the people in this field in relation to the

633
01:07:43.070 --> 01:07:45.029
John Day: organization. They belong to.

634
01:07:45.030 --> 01:07:45.650
hal shear: Yes.

635
01:07:46.700 --> 01:07:48.220
John Day: Alright, let's try that.

636
01:08:11.540 --> 01:08:16.189
John Day: So what it's doing right away is writing an excel. It's writing a a Javascript.

637
01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:18.190
hal shear: To go in and analyze it.

638
01:08:39.450 --> 01:08:44.770
John Day: Say, did you see the visualization of the discussion we had with George

639
01:08:45.198 --> 01:08:46.810
John Day: sent that out in an email.

640
01:08:47.270 --> 01:08:47.920
hal shear: Yes.

641
01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:48.990
John Day: Okay. Good.

642
01:08:48.990 --> 01:08:59.580
hal shear: I got that Yup and I frankly, I think it's it was absolutely terrific. They edit.

643
01:09:00.401 --> 01:09:06.019
hal shear: you know, as I'm trying to explain the impact of how AI is useful.

644
01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:08.454
hal shear: It was a great example.

645
01:09:09.060 --> 01:09:10.620
hal shear: So I really like it.

646
01:09:19.319 --> 01:09:23.629
John Day: So at some point, if we get this off the ground, there's gonna have to be some

647
01:09:23.959 --> 01:09:26.199
John Day: type of structure, for, you know.

648
01:09:27.059 --> 01:09:29.969
John Day: for people office hours, if you will.

649
01:09:31.509 --> 01:09:36.889
John Day: Yeah, I suppose you had a couple of Sdls that finally got motivated to do this. They're gonna get stuck. And

650
01:09:37.259 --> 01:09:49.259
John Day: we would, I think, have to have some type of weekly meeting where they come and say, All right. I'm trying to do this, but I don't know how to move along and show them how to do that, because otherwise I think that the barrier is just

651
01:09:49.569 --> 01:09:51.129
John Day: probably too large.

652
01:09:51.899 --> 01:09:53.619
hal shear: Yeah, I would agree with that.

653
01:09:55.119 --> 01:09:57.369
John Day: It's not a trivial thing we're trying to do.

654
01:09:57.370 --> 01:10:03.119
hal shear: No, but let me. While we're waiting for this, let me make the other point I wanted.

655
01:10:04.670 --> 01:10:14.230
hal shear: I think it's time to begin to share some of the information we've created on the project. 2025 analysis

656
01:10:14.490 --> 01:10:19.340
hal shear: and as I I think we now have

657
01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:22.560
hal shear: a good sense of the executive orders. We know.

658
01:10:23.136 --> 01:10:30.720
hal shear: the the challenges cause. You had a wonderful vaccination of that. And we now have the people.

659
01:10:30.940 --> 01:10:31.960
hal shear: Okay.

660
01:10:32.190 --> 01:10:36.619
hal shear: What we don't have is we haven't addressed the question of

661
01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:40.210
hal shear: the impact on the law that is.

662
01:10:40.350 --> 01:10:51.459
hal shear: on bills that have passed the Congress and signed into law. At this point. We have one right, the big, bad, beautiful Bill.

663
01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:53.270
hal shear: And so

664
01:10:53.980 --> 01:11:04.149
hal shear: that's you know. That's the next step in terms of understanding the the comparison between what was in the mandate, and what's

665
01:11:04.290 --> 01:11:05.790
hal shear: in the bill.

666
01:11:05.940 --> 01:11:12.380
hal shear: But before we do that, I think we could share some of this with

667
01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:16.439
hal shear: people we wanted to share it with, and I'm again.

668
01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:18.050
hal shear: I don't know.

669
01:11:19.730 --> 01:11:25.539
hal shear: because I don't know the cast of characters that well, to know exactly how we ought to do that.

670
01:11:25.740 --> 01:11:35.229
hal shear: I mean, I can think of people that are not part of valley that might be interested. But I like to stay focused on Valley people if if we can.

671
01:11:36.710 --> 01:11:37.500
John Day: Sure.

672
01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:47.040
John Day: So it made an error. Yes, I'm I'll get back to that.

673
01:12:05.900 --> 01:12:12.970
John Day: I mentioned to Ted what we're doing, and I said at some point we might want to send out a newsletter.

674
01:12:13.650 --> 01:12:18.380
John Day: so maybe a newsletter to introduce

675
01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:24.419
John Day: the effort, and that requires some shaping and and thought.

676
01:12:24.890 --> 01:12:31.600
John Day: and some examples of what we could do. Now I was very keen that

677
01:12:34.790 --> 01:12:42.070
John Day: Jim Dinatale was. That was something that I thought he he probably could help a lot. But now he he's you know.

678
01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:49.691
John Day: not that's not with us anymore. But I think that that would be a good

679
01:12:51.820 --> 01:13:02.090
John Day: probably that would be a good approach. Okay? So you can see here that it's not working.

680
01:13:02.670 --> 01:13:03.330
hal shear: No.

681
01:13:04.170 --> 01:13:09.009
John Day: Well, but this is you know, part and parcel of it. So all I'm gonna do is take a screenshot.

682
01:13:27.460 --> 01:13:31.394
John Day: and sometimes it takes a little cycling around before you get it.

683
01:13:33.370 --> 01:13:42.619
hal shear: Okay. You know we've now. We've now answered the question that I had, which was.

684
01:13:42.740 --> 01:13:48.189
hal shear: How do we? How do we get this out, and I think the idea of a newsletter

685
01:13:48.310 --> 01:13:55.070
hal shear: is a really good one and mean, do you think about

686
01:13:55.340 --> 01:13:57.397
hal shear: who can help us with that?

687
01:13:57.740 --> 01:14:04.460
John Day: Yeah, can, hey? Well, hey, can you try to influence Lois?

688
01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:18.910
John Day: Say, we'll help you. But we would like you to help us write a newsletter she might be, you know. She might be interested in doing that. She took a course. She's kind of interested in it, but I think it was getting to be too weighty for her.

689
01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:19.730
hal shear: Yeah.

690
01:14:20.620 --> 01:14:27.230
hal shear: Okay. Well, let me. I'll I'll ask. In the meanwhile, try to think of some other people that might be interested.

691
01:14:27.230 --> 01:14:34.446
John Day: Yeah, yeah. And you know, I I would like to get it out soon enough. But it's still early days, I think.

692
01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:39.969
hal shear: Well, but the the nice thing is that since we have a June 30th

693
01:14:41.038 --> 01:14:44.729
hal shear: set of facts or information

694
01:14:46.020 --> 01:14:50.510
hal shear: I think it's nice to to use that, and

695
01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:54.039
hal shear: you know, so I think timing is the right timing

696
01:14:54.600 --> 01:15:01.060
hal shear: and you know whether, when they publish a newsletter is up to them, but I think it's

697
01:15:01.930 --> 01:15:05.120
hal shear: I think timing is good, so.

698
01:15:08.540 --> 01:15:13.390
John Day: The sprawling sprawling effort.

699
01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:22.089
John Day: But and we we gotta keep that distinct

700
01:15:22.930 --> 01:15:29.380
John Day: from some of the fundamental changes that we're trying to make. And, as you quite correctly

701
01:15:29.870 --> 01:15:37.400
John Day: stated earlier, we're trying to change how people learn things that's not trivial.

702
01:15:37.740 --> 01:15:39.540
hal shear: Yeah. Oh, okay. Here you go.

703
01:15:47.910 --> 01:15:49.000
John Day: Okay.

704
01:15:49.420 --> 01:15:51.480
hal shear: Good, so.

705
01:15:52.390 --> 01:15:54.830
John Day: So now- now.

706
01:15:58.940 --> 01:16:02.930
John Day: Oh, no, I gotta tell it digital wrong format.

707
01:16:06.250 --> 01:16:07.689
hal shear: You don't use, publish.

708
01:16:09.260 --> 01:16:14.780
John Day: Yeah, no. What I have to do is rewrite this as an HTML, okay?

709
01:16:15.890 --> 01:16:19.858
John Day: So what it'll do it'll it'll it'll create something that I can

710
01:16:21.130 --> 01:16:28.620
John Day: make into an H. Tml, Link, I'll do that. I'll add it to our library, and I'll send it to you. So I've started

711
01:16:28.900 --> 01:16:32.806
John Day: a library. I think I've started a library for

712
01:16:34.150 --> 01:16:35.340
John Day: Let me go look

713
01:16:43.620 --> 01:16:46.239
John Day: Oh, where's the data?

714
01:16:52.500 --> 01:16:55.100
John Day: So yep.

715
01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:05.140
John Day: and Github and get Github carniments.

716
01:17:05.380 --> 01:17:06.470
John Day: Oh, no!

717
01:17:08.830 --> 01:17:12.070
John Day: So I paused a little bit there.

718
01:17:16.980 --> 01:17:19.520
John Day: So I gotta think about this a little bit. Let's talk.

719
01:17:19.900 --> 01:17:29.329
John Day: I'm creating different containers to for storing things like web pages.

720
01:17:30.010 --> 01:17:31.990
hal shear: Updated Visualizations.

721
01:17:32.310 --> 01:17:38.140
John Day: So should I make it a separate one for Project 2025, or should I just call it current events and put it there.

722
01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:45.130
hal shear: I don't know.

723
01:17:47.870 --> 01:17:52.280
hal shear: I guess I guess there's no reason it couldn't be in both right.

724
01:17:52.750 --> 01:17:59.550
John Day: Well, that's what I'm saying. It's it's it's it's of that sort. So maybe just get started. We'll just leave it in current

725
01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:07.689
John Day: and current events, and then maybe change. So now, what this allows us to do

726
01:18:08.420 --> 01:18:12.610
John Day: is, oh, there's a there's a 1 that I did for Saul.

727
01:18:13.980 --> 01:18:17.849
John Day: You could start looking at these things, and it would.

728
01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:21.399
John Day: The infrastructure is already there

729
01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:39.729
John Day: for us to create a library for an Sdl. To go and see what are all the data visualizations that have been created, and they can see. Oh, this voting paradox that could be interesting. They could bring that up. Maybe they want to use that, or they contact us and says, Hey, this is pretty close, but

730
01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:44.670
John Day: it's very direct to be able to

731
01:18:45.207 --> 01:18:48.960
John Day: create these data visualizations and then making them available.

732
01:18:49.130 --> 01:18:55.440
John Day: So we might want to try that with the, you know some, you know. Some people, you see, see how that would work.

733
01:18:56.990 --> 01:19:03.470
hal shear: Yeah, I think that again, it's gonna take the more sophisticated people to

734
01:19:03.710 --> 01:19:06.200
hal shear: to take the time to do that.

735
01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:08.970
John Day: Well, yeah.

736
01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:13.810
hal shear: But any event, yeah, let me think about that.

737
01:19:14.350 --> 01:19:15.070
John Day: Yeah, right?

738
01:19:15.480 --> 01:19:17.036
John Day: We don't have to do it all this. And

739
01:19:17.210 --> 01:19:25.419
hal shear: Yeah, no, it's okay. And if when you have time, you can look at our project 2025

740
01:19:26.660 --> 01:19:36.799
hal shear: board and see that I've updated the of the introductory language such that

741
01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:41.280
hal shear: that might be a good way to do the to begin the newsletter.

742
01:19:41.380 --> 01:19:44.459
hal shear: So I'll I'll play with that, too.

743
01:19:45.430 --> 01:19:52.095
John Day: Alright. So I did have on the agenda for today to talk about an upcoming

744
01:19:53.300 --> 01:19:59.250
John Day: communication to Bali as a whole. But this is a you know.

745
01:19:59.410 --> 01:20:07.099
John Day: This is like going out to meet Napoleon and do battle, and our our ranks are a bit thin, right.

746
01:20:07.100 --> 01:20:21.609
hal shear: Yeah, if if there's anything I can do to slow down your generalization, and and you know, try to make it, as

747
01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:35.530
hal shear: you know, useful and as possible, not from a technical standpoint. If you got that down, but how to how to make sure that you're gonna get the maximum interest.

748
01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:38.219
hal shear: That's my! That's my feeling.

749
01:20:38.630 --> 01:20:43.649
John Day: Yeah, no, I I quite agree. And I I understand that I'm not the right person to

750
01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:46.469
John Day: my mind doesn't work in that way.

751
01:20:47.130 --> 01:20:49.260
John Day: So no, I'm serious and.

752
01:20:49.260 --> 01:20:50.870
hal shear: No. Well, yeah.

753
01:20:50.870 --> 01:20:59.810
John Day: That's just the way life is. Or you know, that's that's the way we're wired. That's why I really wanna get enough people in our group

754
01:21:00.190 --> 01:21:02.559
John Day: that have different perspectives. I was very

755
01:21:02.680 --> 01:21:04.680
John Day: keen on having Jim in the group

756
01:21:05.371 --> 01:21:26.249
John Day: because he did that in the past, and I thought that would be extremely useful. I think Dave Chelsea had could you know, can add to it. But somebody more, you know, less technical. And you know, maybe we can convince Lois that we really need help with the communications, and she might she might be willing to help help us

757
01:21:27.550 --> 01:21:39.070
John Day: alright. Well, I'll finish this exercise. I'll create the web page and put it in current events, and I'll send you a link to the web page so you can review it, and bounce it against the spreadsheet and see that it makes sense.

758
01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:39.910
hal shear: Good.

759
01:21:40.110 --> 01:21:41.220
hal shear: Okay.

760
01:21:41.390 --> 01:21:42.570
John Day: So.

761
01:21:43.020 --> 01:21:45.160
hal shear: Are you here next week, or is that

762
01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:48.649
hal shear: I'm here? I've got my son coming in.

763
01:21:48.870 --> 01:21:56.109
hal shear: so I may have a little time constraint, but as long as I have something in advance.

764
01:21:56.340 --> 01:22:02.910
hal shear: yeah, my son's coming in from Hawaii to go to Mit for a week, and

765
01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:07.019
hal shear: so he's gonna be busy during the day, so I don't have to worry about that.

766
01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:17.029
hal shear: But in general, all you have to do is just give me an idea of what would work best for you, and I'll try to work around that.

767
01:22:17.390 --> 01:22:20.440
John Day: We'll have a meeting next Friday. At the same time.

768
01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:23.140
hal shear: Friday, the.

769
01:22:23.770 --> 01:22:25.439
John Day: A lot of the 18, th I think.

770
01:22:26.190 --> 01:22:27.769
hal shear: Yeah, the 18.th

771
01:22:28.420 --> 01:22:35.229
hal shear: Yeah, that would be I that that certainly would work for me. Okay, so I'll put that in

772
01:22:35.540 --> 01:22:37.369
hal shear: or 2 o'clock.

773
01:22:38.490 --> 01:22:39.829
John Day: Yeah, I'll send that. I'll send that on.

774
01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:40.210
hal shear: Okay.

775
01:22:40.210 --> 01:22:44.980
John Day: So speaking of sons, our son just bought a house in New Hampshire. There

776
01:22:46.370 --> 01:22:54.740
John Day: they were in Manchester, New Hampshire. Now they're moving to a more rural setting in Chester, New Hampshire, which is east of it.

777
01:22:54.950 --> 01:22:56.970
John Day: So that's a lot of excitement on that.

778
01:22:57.863 --> 01:23:00.310
hal shear: I'm sure I'm sure.

779
01:23:00.490 --> 01:23:01.270
John Day: Yeah.

780
01:23:01.270 --> 01:23:02.189
hal shear: All right.

781
01:23:02.350 --> 01:23:05.689
hal shear: Well, have fun, and we'll talk

782
01:23:06.050 --> 01:23:08.609
hal shear: alright. I'll send you this link once I get it sorted. Okay.

783
01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:10.319
John Day: Good discussion today.

784
01:23:10.610 --> 01:23:11.340
hal shear: Yeah.

785
01:23:11.470 --> 01:23:13.000
John Day: Too bad. It was just the 2 of us.

786
01:23:13.310 --> 01:23:13.950
hal shear: Yep.

787
01:23:14.580 --> 01:23:15.480
John Day: Alright talk to you later.

788
01:23:15.480 --> 01:23:16.119
hal shear: Alright, bye.

789
01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:16.750
John Day: Bye.
