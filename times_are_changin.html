    <div class="intro">
        They told us the old order was returning. They promised a new "Golden Age." But here we are, one year in, and the waters are rising. The Authoritarian Project promised efficiency and strength. The American Democratic Project? Well, it turns out it had some fight left in it after all. You better start swimmin', because if you don't, you'll sink like a stone.

    <h2>Come writers and critics who prophesize with your pen</h2>
    
    <p>Let's start with the courts, shall we? Because nothing says "popular mandate" quite like <span class="stat">530 lawsuits</span> filed against your administration in your first year. That's not a typo. <span class="stat">Five hundred and thirty.</span> To put that in perspective, Biden faced fewer than 50 in his first 100 days. Obama? About 30. But Trump's second act? He's shattered all records.</p>
    
    <p class="citation">(<a href="https://thefulcrum.us/rule-of-law/supreme-court-rulings-2025" target="_blank">The Fulcrum, November 19, 2025</a>)</p>
    
    <p>And here's the kicker: of the 32 cases fully adjudicated by May, Trump lost 24 of them. Courts have issued <span class="stat">over 200 orders</span> stopping his administration's actions. Federal judges—including ones he appointed—keep putting the brakes on this runaway train.</p>
    
    <p class="citation">(<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2025-lawsuits-against-trump-administration/" target="_blank">Bloomberg, May 8, 2025</a>)</p>
    
    <p><span class="dylan-voice">The wheel's still in spin, but the judges ain't winnin'.</span> Twenty-two states, led by New York's Letitia James, sued over the federal grant freeze. California's Attorney General Rob Bonta has filed <span class="stat">54 lawsuits</span> with "resounding success"—securing 12 final rulings, 35 preliminary injunctions, and watching the administration back down entirely in six cases rather than defend their "illegal actions" in court.</p>

    <p>The Supreme Court? Even they're getting tired of it. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson voted against the administration in <span class="stat">every single one</span> of 24 emergency docket cases. Chief Justice Roberts joined the liberal justices in dissent on funding terminations. When you've lost John Roberts...</p>

    <h2>Come senators, congressmen, please heed the call</h2>
    
    <p>But forget the courts for a moment. Let's talk about the streets. Because while the lawyers file motions, the people have been marching.</p>
    
    <p>February 5, 2025: The <span class="stat">50501 movement</span> (50 protests, 50 states, one day) draws thousands to state capitols nationwide. February 17: "Not My President's Day" rallies multiply. April 5: The <span class="stat">Hands Off protests</span> become the largest single-day rally with over <span class="stat">1,400 events</span> in all 50 states, drawing an estimated <span class="stat">three to five million participants</span>. That's bigger than anything in Trump's first term.</p>
    
    <p class="citation">(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hands_Off_protests" target="_blank">Wikipedia, "Hands Off protests"</a>; <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/19/nx-s1-5369483/anti-trump-protests-50501-tesla-takedown" target="_blank">NPR, April 20, 2025</a>)</p>
    
    <p>June 14: The <span class="stat">No Kings protests</span>—reportedly the largest day of protest in U.S. history—spread across the nation on Trump's 79th birthday. Not exactly the party he was hoping for.</p>
    
    <p class="citation">(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50501_movement" target="_blank">Wikipedia, "50501 movement"</a>)</p>
    
    <p><span class="dylan-voice">And you better start swimmin' or you'll sink like a stone.</span> Here's what's different from 2017: these protests are reaching deep into Trump country. Professor Erica Chenoweth's research shows protests are now appearing in counties that voted overwhelmingly for Trump. In his first term, the average was 40 protesters per 10,000 people in Trump counties. Now? <span class="stat">65 per 10,000.</span> They're peaceful, persistent, and they're everywhere.</p>
    
    <p class="citation">(<a href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty-research/policy-topics/advocacy-social-movements/anti-trump-protests-are-making-headway" target="_blank">Harvard Kennedy School, October 2025</a>)</p>

    <h2>Come mothers and fathers throughout the land</h2>
    
    <p>Then there are the institutions. Harvard University looked at Trump's demands—audit your viewpoints, reduce the power of certain faculty, discontinue DEI—and said something you don't hear much anymore: <span class="dylan-voice">No.</span></p>
    
    <p>President Alan Garber's response was crystal clear: "The University will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights. No government—regardless of which party is in power—should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue."</p>
    
    <p class="citation">(<a href="https://www.harvard.edu/president/news/2025/the-promise-of-american-higher-education/" target="_blank">Harvard University President, April 14, 2025</a>)</p>
    
    <p>The administration froze <span class="stat">$2.2 billion</span> in funding. Harvard sued. And in September, Judge Allison D. Burroughs delivered a scathing 84-page ruling: the administration had used "antisemitism as a smokescreen for a targeted, ideologically-motivated assault on this country's premier universities." The funding was restored.</p>
    
    <p class="citation">(<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-administration-appeals-ruling-restoring-2-7b-federal-funding-harvard" target="_blank">Fox News, December 19, 2025</a>)</p>
    
    <p>But Harvard didn't stand alone. Over <span class="stat">150 university and college presidents</span> signed a statement condemning "unprecedented government overreach." Big Ten faculties approved "mutual-defense compacts." Columbia, after initially caving, reversed course and rejected "heavy-handed orchestration from the government."</p>

    <h2>The line it is drawn, the curse it is cast</h2>
    
    <p>Corporate America? Well, they're scared. But even fear has its limits. Shareholders at Apple, Costco, Coca-Cola, Goldman Sachs, and Berkshire Hathaway <span class="stat">overwhelmingly rejected</span> anti-DEI proposals pushed by conservative activists. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting is suing Trump for trying to fire board members. Law firms Jenner & Block, WilmerHale, and Perkins Coie are legally challenging executive orders targeting them.</p>
    
    <p class="citation">(<a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/15/trump-harvard-pbs-dei" target="_blank">Axios, May 15, 2025</a>)</p>
    
    <p>Even the conservative media is starting to crack. The Wall Street Journal, New York Post, and—wait for it—<span class="stat">Fox News</span> have all pushed back on Trump's economic policies. When Rupert Murdoch's empire starts to waver, you know the waters are rising.</p>
    
    <p class="citation">(<a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/16/nx-s1-5328623/trump-is-getting-pushback-from-an-unlikely-place-the-conservative-media" target="_blank">NPR, March 16, 2025</a>)</p>
    
    <p>Meanwhile, journalism itself is fighting back. The Associated Press sued after being barred from White House events for refusing to call the Gulf of Mexico the "Gulf of America." The New York Times, Reuters, and NPR refused to sign Pentagon documents that would have muzzled their reporting. Despite <span class="stat">170 assaults on journalists</span> by law enforcement in 2025, despite funding cuts and threats, the press keeps reporting.</p>

    <h2>As the present now will later be past</h2>
    
    <p>And then there are the polls. Oh, the polls. Trump's approval rating sits at a dismal <span class="stat">38-44%</span>, depending on which survey you trust. His <span class="dylan-voice">signature issue</span>—immigration—has crashed to <span class="stat">39% approval</span>, the lowest of his second term. A majority—<span class="stat">58%</span>—say ICE has gone "too far" in enforcement.</p>

    <p>The economy? <span class="stat">54% say the country is worse off</span> than a year ago. <span class="stat">70% give him negative economic ratings.</span> And <span class="stat">58% say he's gone too far</span> in using presidential power—up from 52% at the start of his term.</p>

    <p>Only <span class="stat">37% say Trump puts the country above personal gain.</span> Just <span class="stat">35% call him someone they're proud to have as president.</span> And while 9 in 10 Republicans still approve, his support among independents has collapsed to <span class="stat">29%</span>.</p>

    <h2>For the loser now will be later to win</h2>
    
    <p>But here's where it gets really interesting: <span class="dylan-voice">MAGA is eating itself.</span></p>
    
    <p>Marjorie Taylor Greene—yes, <span class="stat">that</span> Marjorie Taylor Greene—broke with Trump over the Epstein files, foreign policy, and what she sees as his abandonment of "America First" principles. Trump called her "Wacky Marjorie" and "Marjorie 'Traitor' Green." She responded: "I don't worship or serve Donald Trump. I remain America First and America Only!!!" Then she resigned from Congress.</p>
    
    <p class="citation">(<a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/11/18/nx-s1-5611107/epstein-files-mtg-trump-maga-gop" target="_blank">NPR, November 18, 2025</a>; <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/11/16/maga-conflict-israel-venezuela-white-nationalism" target="_blank">Axios, November 16, 2025</a>)</p>
    
    <p>Tucker Carlson and Steve Bannon are openly criticizing Trump for spending "too much time on Palestine and not enough on East Palestine, Ohio." The H1-B visa debate split MAGA between Silicon Valley tech bros and the "America First" base. Conservative commentators are blasting Trump's $20 billion bailout of Argentina while American cattle ranchers suffer.</p>
    
    <p class="citation">(<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/18/politics/maga-movement-trump-epstein-division" target="_blank">CNN, November 18, 2025</a>; <a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/11/15/donald-trumps-america-first-movement-seems-to-be-fracturing/" target="_blank">Salon, November 15, 2025</a>)</p>
    
    <p>When Trump bombed Iran in June, the MAGA movement fractured down the middle—isolationists versus hawks, with Tucker Carlson and Candace Owens leading the opposition. As one poll showed, only <span class="stat">39% of Republicans supported military action</span> in Venezuela, while 29% opposed it.</p>
    
    <p class="citation">(<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/22/politics/maga-movement-divided-trump-iran" target="_blank">CNN, June 22, 2025</a>; <a href="https://maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/u-s-foreign-policy-january-2026/" target="_blank">Marist Poll, January 2026</a>)</p>
    
    <p>Even Ben Shapiro is admitting the emperor has no clothes: "When President Trump says things are becoming more affordable, people don't believe that they are becoming more affordable because they aren't really more affordable."</p>
    
    <p class="citation">(<a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/11/15/donald-trumps-america-first-movement-seems-to-be-fracturing/" target="_blank">Salon, November 15, 2025</a>)</p>

    <h2>The order is rapidly fadin'</h2>
    
    <p><span class="dylan-voice">So here we are, friends.</span> One year into the "Golden Age," and the Authoritarian Project is running into the immovable object of American democracy. Five hundred and thirty lawsuits. Millions in the streets. Harvard standing firm. The AP fighting back. MAGA turning on itself. Approval ratings in the toilet.</p>
    
    <p>Dylan sang about the old order fading in 1964. Sixty years later, it's a different old order trying to reassert itself. But the waters have grown. The people are swimming. And those who thought they could stand still are finding themselves drenched to the bone.</p>
    
    <p>The courts are checking power. The streets are filled with voices. The institutions—battered but not broken—are finding their spine. The polls show a nation unconvinced. And the movement that seemed unstoppable is discovering that coalitions built on personality cults tend to fracture when the personality starts to crack.</p>
    
    <p class="dylan-voice">For the times they are a-changin'.</p>
    
    <p>You better start swimmin'. Or you'll sink like a stone.</p>
