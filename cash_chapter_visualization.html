                Darl set fire to Gillespie's barn in an attempt to end the nightmarish journey by cremating Addie's decomposing corpse. Vardaman witnessed it, told Dewey Dell (who told him to keep quiet), but Gillespie figured it out anyway. The family must either commit Darl to the asylum in Jackson or face a lawsuit. This is Cash, the methodical carpenter, trying to rationalize an impossible moral situation.

                Sometimes I ain't so sho who's got ere a right to say when a man is crazy and when he ain't. Sometimes I think it ain't none of us pure crazy and ain't none of us pure sane until the balance of us talks him that-a-way. It's like it ain't so much what a fellow does, but it's the way the majority of folks is looking at him when he does it.

            <p class="narrative">
                Because Jewel is too hard on him. Of course it was Jewel's horse was traded to get her that nigh to town, and in a sense it was the value of his horse Darl tried to burn up. But I thought more than once how it would be God's blessing if He did take her outen our hands and get shut of her in some clean way.
            </p>
            <div class="key-moment">
                I can almost believe he done right in a way. But I don't reckon nothing excuses setting fire to a man's barn and endangering his stock and destroying his property. That's how I reckon a man is crazy. That's how he can't see eye to eye with other folks.

            <div class="explanatory-note">
                <div class="note-title">Cash's Moral Dilemma:</div>
                Cash understands that Darl's arson was arguably an act of mercy—trying to end the grotesque spectacle of dragging a rotting corpse through the Mississippi heat. But he falls back on conventional morality: destroying property is wrong, and those who can't "see eye to eye with other folks" must be crazy. Notice how Cash defines sanity not as a state of mind, but as conformity to majority opinion. He's deeply conflicted, knowing his carpenter's ethics don't really apply here.

            <div class="section-title">The Chicken Coop & The Courthouse</div>
            <div class="philosophical">
                It's like some folks has the smooth, pretty boards to build a court-house with and others don't have no more than rough lumber fitten to build a chicken coop. But it's better to build a tight chicken coop than a shoddy court-house, and when they both build shoddy or build well, neither because it's one or tother is going to make a man feel the better nor the worse.
            </div>
            <p class="narrative">
                That's it. It's because me and him was born close together, and it nigh ten years before Jewel and Dewey Dell and Vardaman begun to come along. I feel kin to them, all right, but I don't know. And me being the oldest, and thinking already the very thing that he done: I don't know.

            <div class="explanatory-note">
                <div class="note-title">The Carpenter's Metaphor:</div>
                Cash's central philosophy: some people get good materials (smooth boards for a courthouse), others get rough lumber (for a chicken coop). What matters is building well with what you have. But then he admits the work itself—good or bad—won't actually make you feel better or worse. His metaphor is breaking down. He's also revealing something crucial: he and Darl are close in age, and Cash himself had thought about ending the journey. The guilt of shared thought haunts him.

                "It'll cost money," pa says.<br>

                So Darl set still and we went on, with Jewel squatting on the tail-gate, watching the back of Darl's head. He looked like one of these bulldogs, one of these dogs that don't bark none, squatting against the rope, watching the thing he was waiting to jump at.

                Anse stops at "Mrs. Bundren's house"—the woman who will become the new Mrs. Bundren, probably within hours of burying Addie. While the family has sacrificed everything (Cash's leg, Jewel's horse and burned back, Darl's sanity), Anse has been planning his remarriage. He's too cheap to buy a spade for his wife's burial, but he's courted a woman with a "little new house" and a graphophone (phonograph—a luxury item). "It was like he knowed"—this was calculated all along. The teeth weren't just vanity; they were for courtship.

I see all the while how folks could say he was queer, but that was the very reason couldn't nobody hold it personal. It was like he was outside of it too, same as you, and getting mad at it would be kind of like getting mad at a mud-puddle that splashed you when you stepped in it.

            <p class="narrative">
                And then I always kind of had a idea that him and Dewey Dell kind of knowed things betwixt them. If I'd 'a' said it was ere a one of us she liked better than ere a other, I'd 'a' said it was Darl.

She jumped on him like a wild cat so that one of the fellows had to quit and hold her and her scratching and clawing at him like a wild cat, while the other one and pa and Jewel throwed Darl down and held him lying on his back, looking up at me.

                This is when Cash realizes Dewey Dell must have revealed Darl's arson to Gillespie. She and Darl supposedly shared a special connection—"knowed things betwixt them." But Dewey Dell was pregnant and desperate to reach Jefferson for an abortion. When Darl tried to end the journey by burning the barn, he threatened her mission. Her violent attack is guilt and rage: she betrayed the brother closest to her because her own desperation trumped loyalty. The family's bonds dissolve into each person's isolated survival.

            Despite all his perceptiveness—his ability to see into everyone's thoughts and motives—Darl still trusted Cash enough to expect a warning. "I thought you would have told me, I never thought you wouldn't have." There's no anger, just bewildered hurt. Even the most insightful character couldn't see this betrayal coming. Cash has no answer because there is no good answer.

                    Darl's uncontrollable laughter is one of the novel's most disturbing moments. It's not joy—it's the sound of something breaking.

                    Darl sees the cosmic joke: he's being committed for the one arguably merciful act in this entire nightmare—trying to end it. The most perceptive character is labeled insane, while Anse (who understands nothing) will walk free with new teeth and a new wife. The universe isn't tragic; it's absurd.

                    <strong style="color: #da70d6;">The Dissolution of Meaning:</strong><br>
                    Cash tries to comfort Darl by saying it will be "better" in the asylum—"quiet, with none of the bothering." But Darl repeats "Better" and can't stop laughing. What does "better" even mean? Better than what? The word has lost all meaning. Language itself is breaking down.

                    <strong style="color: #da70d6;">The Final Clarity:</strong><br>
                    Darl's laughter may be the sanest response possible. He sees clearly: the family that claims to honor their mother has desecrated her corpse, everyone has betrayed everyone else, suffering has taught nothing, and the worst character wins. If you truly see reality in Faulkner's universe, laughter or madness (or both) is the only honest response.

                    <strong style="color: #da70d6;">Cash's Horror:</strong><br>
                    "I be durn if I could see anything to laugh at." Cash can't understand because he's still trying to find moral order, still clinging to his carpenter's philosophy. But Darl has moved past that—he's seen through to the fundamental meaninglessness. The laughter is the sound of that recognition, and it terrifies those who haven't seen it yet.

            Because there just ain't nothing justifies the deliberate destruction of what a man has built with his own sweat and stored the fruit of his sweat into. But I ain't so sho that ere a man has the right to say what is crazy and what ain't. It's like there was a fellow in every man that's done a-past the sanity or the insanity, that watches the sane and the insane doings of that man with the same horror and the same astonishment.

            <div class="note-title">Cash's Final Admission:</div>
            After all his attempts to justify the decision through his carpenter's philosophy and appeals to majority opinion, Cash ends by admitting he doesn't know what sanity is. He suggests there's something in each person that exists "a-past the sanity or the insanity"—a consciousness that watches both states with equal horror and astonishment. This may be Faulkner's ultimate statement: we're all simultaneously sane and insane, and no one has the right to judge. Yet they judge anyway, and Darl goes to Jackson.
