            <div class="speaker">JOHN DAY</div>
            <div class="content">So, anytime you want to address him, all you gotta do is say "Hey, Ed," ask him a question, and he'll respond. There's some rules that I've implemented to make sure that the avatar fits in comfortably with what everybody else is doing. A couple of rules are, if you want a one-line response, you just say, "hey Ed, what's the weather today?"</div>

            <div class="speaker">JOHN DAY</div>
            <div class="content">Actually, what I've done… I'm using ChatGPT for this. It's the best voice recognition and control of all of the chatbots. And there's something in ChatGPT, it also exists in Claude, which is a project. So, in the project, you can add files, a lot of files, to give context to responses to prompts, and that's useful. But they're also instructions, and so I worked for a little bit, and I created some instructions for Ed Murrow.</div>

            <div class="content">Certainly, I'll speak to that with the gravity it deserves. In confronting Senator McCarthy, my aim was always to uphold truth and evidence. We must remember that the record shows dissent is not disloyalty, and accusation is not proof. That historical precedent informs it took moral courage then, just as it does now, to challenge assumptions and insist on verified facts.</div>

            <div class="content">Yeah, so, I think it's very similar to what you're doing. I'm planning a course the future of AI, or how it's going to shape society. And for the spring. And what I'd like to do is... just to... have an avatar in the class. And if someone asks something, not necessarily me answer it, but if... if the avatar has access to the information in the project, just have the avatar answer it, because I think that'll give people a sense of kind of AI in action.</div>

            <div class="content">So, it follows the pattern of the other proposal, in which the first two weeks are the technical aspects of dealing with the computer. But then... when we get into the following 3 weeks, what I did is I divided it into course development, assembling course materials within AI, and course delivery and continuous improvement.</div>

I think that she would say, this looks great, but can we make it a workshop, a several session workshop, instead of a full course?</div>

            <div class="content">So, just a moment for a brutal candor about BOLLI, and where we are and what we're trying to do. I think there's a big challenge to move forward from just people get together and use the computer to talk to one another, you know, see their faces and have spontaneous conversation, to a more disciplined consideration or investigation of a particular topic.</div>

            <div class="content">I think you have been kind of leading the charge in showing people what can be done with AI, and now your proposal on showing SGLs how to use AI is a good example of offering ways to move it forward. I don't know what the uptake will be, because I think we've got a bunch of Luddites, both the membership and the SGL, so it could be slow progress.</div>

            <div class="content">What really interests me profoundly about what we're doing... Using the AI can help facilitate finding some information, and you're doing the mechanics that we're talking about. And it also... I've used it a lot to understand the dynamics of the courses I'm teaching. Who speaks? Who doesn't speak? What do they say?</div>

        <div class="technical-note">
            <strong>Session End:</strong> The conversation concludes with Ed Murrow apparently timing out (reaching the hourly limit for voice interaction), demonstrating one of the practical limitations of current AI avatar implementations.

        <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Technical Implementation:</strong> AI avatars can be created using ChatGPT's project feature with custom instructions and context files to create consistent personas.</li>
            <li><strong>Educational Value:</strong> Avatars can serve as interactive teaching assistants, providing students with hands-on experience of AI capabilities.</li>
            <li><strong>Infrastructure Needs:</strong> Successful implementation requires proper audio/visual setup, potentially including separate computers and hybrid classroom configurations.</li>
            <li><strong>Adoption Strategy:</strong> Starting with small pilot groups and workshops may be more effective than broad rollouts, given varying comfort levels with technology.</li>
            <li><strong>Future Potential:</strong> The conversation reveals both the exciting possibilities and current limitations of AI in educational settings.</li>

                <h3 style="color: #27ae60;">✅ What Worked Well</h3>
                
                <h4>1. Demonstration of Capabilities</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>The avatar effectively showcased AI's potential when Ollie asked substantive questions (e.g., about Joe McCarthy, comparing broadcasts)</li>
                    <li>It provided thoughtful, contextual responses that stayed in character as Ed Murrow</li>
                    <li>Successfully demonstrated memory of previous conversations with John</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>2. Educational Value</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Served as a live example of AI in action for Ollie's planned course</li>
                    <li>Showed how AI can maintain context across conversations ("intellectual capital")</li>
                    <li>Demonstrated real-time web search capabilities when asked about token limits</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>3. Natural Integration Points</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>When used for synthesis (summarizing the conversation)</li>
                    <li>When asked for specific comparisons or analysis</li>
                    <li>When providing suggestions for Ollie's course</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div>
                <h3 style="color: #e74c3c;">⚠️ What Didn't Work Well</h3>
                
                <h4>1. Flow Interruptions</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Multiple false starts and connection issues at the beginning</li>
                    <li>Avatar interrupted conversations with "Sorry, returning to listening mode" multiple times</li>
                    <li>Required explicit commands to remain silent ("Hey Ed, just remain silent now")</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>2. Control Issues</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>The avatar seemed to have difficulty distinguishing when to listen vs. respond</li>
                    <li>John had to act as a constant mediator/controller</li>
                    <li>The listening mode wasn't foolproof - the avatar still interjected occasionally</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>3. Technical Limitations</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wooden, repetitive phrases (as John noted: "it's starting to give wooden responses")</li>
                    <li>Difficulty answering technical specifications directly</li>
                    <li>Eventually timed out due to hourly usage limit</li>
                </ul>

                        <li>Perhaps a "raise hand" feature for when it has something relevant to add</li>
                        <li>Better at staying quiet during human-to-human discussion unless specifically invited</li>
                    </ul>

            <h3 style="color: #2c3e50; margin-top: 0;">📊 Overall Assessment</h3>
            <p>The avatar served its primary purpose well - demonstrating AI capabilities and sparking ideas for educational use. However, it functioned more as a <strong>demonstration tool that required active management</strong> rather than as a seamless third participant in the conversation. The most successful moments were when it was given specific tasks (compare X and Y, summarize our discussion, search for information) rather than trying to participate organically in the flow of conversation.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Key Insight:</strong> The avatar works best as an on-demand resource rather than an autonomous conversational participant. This suggests that for educational settings, AI avatars might be most effective when used in a structured, task-oriented manner rather than as free-flowing discussion partners.</p>
